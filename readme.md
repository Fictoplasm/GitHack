# About GitHack

This is the generic, GitHub available version of my game *StormHack*. That game was originally developed as an OSR-like system that could be used to run *Stormbringer*-like adventures in Moorcockâ€™s Young Kingdoms, but this version is much more generic. It's still intended to embrace the sword-and-sorcery, doomed hero schtick.

There are three components to the system:

* **Core** is the main game
* **Modules** are implementations, supporting random tables, and other options
* **Resources** are additional things like graphics, character sheets and other non-text items

## Why GitHub?

Even though you can freely collaborate on some indie games the static pdf format isn't optimal. This is a different approach to make it easier to collaborate by presenting it like a software project. The text is in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) making it highly portable whilst supporting basic formatting and tables in a human readable way. You can then take the markdown text and convert it with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) or view it with your chosen markdown viewer.

Since this is a GitHub project you can clone or fork the repo and submit your own commits for the main branch. You can use Git from the command line and make edits with any text editor, see where your content differs from the main branch, and so on. However there are also graphical tools and plugins available. I recommend [atom.io](https://atom.io) which integrates with GitHub nicely and has a lot of useful packages for writing and rendering markdown, and it's cross-platform.
