# GitHack

**GitHack** is a free, OGL, OSR, setting agnostic sword-and-sorcery game. It was developed after [StormHack](https://fictoplasm.itch.io/stormhack-exclamation-edition), an OSR-like system that could be used to run *Stormbringer*-like adventures in Moorcockâ€™s Young Kingdoms.

There are two folders: the **Core** (for system), and the **Extras** for optional settings, rules, and "everything else".
