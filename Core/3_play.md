## 3.0 Play

This are the moving parts of the system.

### 3.1 Ability Checks

The core die roll is a d20 vs. an Ability Score, trying to roll equal to or below that score for a simple pass/fail result. The d20 is rolled for all kinds of basic skill test, and also for Saving Throws.

If you want more granularity try the following scale:

| Roll | Success                                               |
|:---- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| 10+  | Great success (maybe additional benefit)              |
| 5+   | Success (generally OK)                                |
| 1-4  | Weak (scraped by, maybe with some compromise or cost) |

I like the 5+ and 10+ thresholds as they’re intuitive, BUT you might want to fudge the margins above to suit your group, e.g.

* get a critical hit by rolling your Ability Score exactly
* weak hits on a 1-3
* set the threshold on a per-roll basis, e.g. the ref says “you need to beat a 6 or it's a weak hit"

This is a bit more flexible, but could also bog things down.

#### Advantage

Whenever you have an Advantage on a particular roll, you can roll 2d20 and pick the result you like. If you have Disadvantage, roll 2d20 and the Referee picks the result they like.

Advantage comes from situations, clever plans, the right equipment, superior positions, and your Backgrounds. If you think your Background would give you an Advantage (say, you're trying to pole vault over a wall, and you're a former acrobat), claim it with the ref, maybe negotiate on why you should get the benefit, and perhaps even do a bit of exposition or backstory for your character if that’s your thing (but be wary of bogging things down).

Backgrounds are specific and the skills that come from them have a context, especially in combat. If you're a gutter thief with form for close knife fighting in a dark alley, you won't get the same advantage on an open battlefield against a pike block. But as always it's down to the conversation between the players and ref.

#### Who does best?

If several party members are rolling the same thing and it really matters who does better than whom, use the numbers on the dice to work out the priority.

> Say Czenk, Skule, Jenna and Aubrey roll an INT check to spot the treasure: Czenk's roll of 17 means they miss, but the other three roll successes of 5, 12 and 9 respectively. This means the 12 is the first to succeed (and Jenna decides to palm a ruby ring before anyone notices).

### 3.2 Hazards and Saving Throws

Saving throws are about lucky escapes. Make a save against an ability score to avoid some or all of the effects of something (an enemy spell, poison, traps, etc.). Wisdom is the default score for all saves, although some groups might prefer to use a different Ability Score, so there’s some alternative save suggestions below.

Saves can be rolled like any other Ability check, with either a pass/fail or a bit more granularity. Saving throws can be triggered by the consequences of bad plans or bad choices, special monster attacks, spell effects, disease or poison and so on.

This table gives some broad suggestions for Hazard types, the effects of failing the save, and what might happen on a weak pass roll if you want that effect. Some alternative Ability Scores for the save are proposed, if you don’t want to default to WIS each time.

| Hazard                                           | Saving Throw                     |
|:------------------------------------------------ |:-------------------------------- |
| Poison, radiation, Death Magic, Disease          | CON                              |
| Paralysis                                        | CON or STR                       |
| Petrification, Polymorph                         | CON or CHA (sense of identity)   |
| Devices (rods, staves, wands)                    | DEX                              |
| Dragon breath, explosions                        | CON or DEX (diving behind cover) | 
| Mind control spells                              | INT                              |
| Traps                                            | INT or DEX                       |
| Dimensional alterations and weirdness, illusions | INT                              |

ONLY ROLL THE SAVE ONCE. Some hazards might be interpreted in more than one way, for example a thief failing to spot a trap gets hit with a poison dart: is this a trap hazard, or a poison hazard? Decide one way or the other before you roll and roll once.

### 3.3 Angst

Angst is existential dread. It starts at zero, and goes up under various circumstances: meddling in cosmic forces, mission setbacks, and other things that cause the heroes to doubt.

In play Angst works to mess up your character's life, and it comes into play whenever you roll a successful saving throw that's equal to or lower than Angst. 
If this happens, the ref should choose one of the following options:

* Make a Deep Wound fester, spreading to other wound boxes, or cause a Wound to become Deep.
* Highlight one of your corrupted Backgrounds (i.e. a background that’s been touched by a Patron through Elan). The referee will then bring that negative aspect into the story, probably with bad social effects.
* Hold one over the party to reverse a positive outcome, hopefully at the worst possible time.

Of course the ref may think of other negative causes.

### 3.4 Elan

Elan is your Demon's awareness and power, and it increases through use of magic.

Any time you roll magic dice, if a die comes up 8+ then add that number to the running total of Elan. Every 100 points of Elan, mark off a new notch on the Demon Track, adjacent to any other mark.

### 3.5 Harm

Harm is “damage” and is marked on the Harm track with either a tick (fatigue, heals quickly), a cross (wound, heals slowly) or a star (a deep wound, needs special treatment). The capacity of your Harm track is equal to CON and Harm starts at zero.

Harm can be anything that negatively affects your PC. It could be physical damage from combat, but equally it could be some kind of mental or emotional drain, or even a social stigma. In general Harm is dealt one point at a time: for example, when a monster does damage, its damage die is rolled against the character’s Armour Class (see the Combat chapter).

#### Healing

Healing depends on circumstances but if the characters are able to at least rest, they can clear some fatigue. If they can get medical attention, they can clear some wound crosses, etc.

When Harm is healed, just remove the appropriate ticks and leave the unhealed ones behind. The next time you take damage, start by filling the highest empty slot. Here’s an example:

> Willhelm is struck 3 times in battle. The first two are just fatiguing scratches worth 1 tick each, but the third is an actual wound, so his player puts a cross against the 3 position. Immediately after the fight Willhelm gets to rest and wipe out the fatigue right there. The ticks disappear, but the cross against number 3 stays because there’s no time to heal the more serious wound.

> The next fight the wound hasn’t healed, but Willhelm still marks off the first empty box opposite 1 for the first bit of damage. When he takes a third hit, the damage leapfrogs over the existing wound and marks box number 4. And so on.

Healing Deep Wounds requires special circumstances (quests, special ingredients, skilled healers, etc.).

#### Wounds getting worse

Wounds can get worse: a tick becomes a cross, and a cross becomes a star. This might be the case if a wound becomes infected (due to missed saving throw, or monster effect), or if the character runs out of Harm boxes (in which case, ticks become crosses, etc.).

#### Deep wounds and festering

Deep wounds are marked with a star on the Harm track. They’re particularly bad because they both need special circumstances to heal them, and they can spread to other boxes.

When Deep wounds fester, they infect the boxes nearby. Rather than leaping over to the next empty box, a festering Deep Wound will first affect the adjacent boxes until they are stars (fatigue, then crosses, then stars).

Example of deep wounds might include injury from a magical blade, a serious infection, a strike from a supernatural creature, a particularly nasty disease.

#### Incapacity and Death

If you keep taking damage, at some point the Harm track will be full of ticks and crosses. When you have no more boxes to fill in, roll a saving throw against CON to stay active.

A fail means you’re incapacitated, or even dead. If the character has more ticks than crosses, they’ll be unconscious but stable. However if they have more crosses than ticks, they’re at risk of death; immediately turn one tick into a cross, and periodically continue to do this (as prompted by the ref) until they’re stabilised.

If you pass, you can continue fighting and acting, but when you take damage next, turn your next tick into a cross and roll a CON save again to check whether you’re incapacitated.
