## 1.0 Creating Characters

### 1.1 Ability Scores

Generate the six **Ability Scores** using any method you like (point-buy, 3d6 down the line, 4d6 drop one, etc.). Range of each score is 3-18 with 10 being average.

This is what each Ability Score is used for:

| Ability      | Activity                                                              |
|:------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | opposing things physically (fighting, pushing, restraining etc)       |
| Constitution | surviving/resisting (fatigue, damage, poison, etc)                    |
| Dexterity    | default for many physical activities (manual dex, speed and agility)  |
| Intelligence | default for many mental tests (knowledge and reasoning, search/scan)  |
| Wisdom       | mental resistance and intuition (gut feel, empathy, willpower)        |
| Charisma     | interacting with people (communicating to impress, intimidate, charm) |

### 1.2 Backgrounds

PCs have three **Backgrounds**:

| Background | Summary                                  | Worldbuilding |
|:---------- |:---------------------------------------- |:------------- |
| Family     | Who you grew up with, what you learned   | Homeland      |
| Company    | Who you fell in with after you left home | Group         |
| Legacy     | Something you inherited at birth         | Legend        |

For each Background tag an Ability Score and write any details in the segment on the Wheel. All Backgrounds give you some kind of advantage in play (skills, experience, contacts, resources). There are no hard and fast rules on what makes each kind of Background, but here are some examples sorted by Ability Score:

#### Strength

| Strength | example                                 |

| Company  | joined a war band, mercenary unit, etc. |
| Legacy   | a weapon handed down by past generation |

#### Constitution

| Constitution | example                                        |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------- |

| Legacy       | inherited membership of a secret society                                                |

| Company  | fell in with artists or players             |
| Legacy   | birthright (title, status, etc)             |

### 1.3 Demon

Your **Demon** is something that sets you apart from others. It could be literally a conjured being, but it could also be a connection to a god, arcane knowledge, or skill beyond what is normally thought possible. The really important points are:

- using the Demon's power causes it to grow
- when the Demon grows, it causes corruption in the character.

The six *Demonic Realms* of the Macrocosm map onto the Microcosm of the human Ability Scores:

| Microcosm    | Macrocosm   | Suits (spells)                  |
|:------------ |:----------- |:------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Puissance   | Force, destruction, combat      |
| Constitution | Durance     | Armour, wards, banishment       |
| Dexterity    | Contrivance | Transport, teleportation, gates |
| Intelligence | Voyance     | Scrying, divination, knowledge  |
| Wisdom       | Abeyance    | Conjuring and objects of desire |
| Charisma     | Obeisance   | Enchantments and possession     |

The Demon *infects* the Wheel via the **Demon Track**. As it grows the infection spreads, which will

- give the PC more **Magic Dice**,
- give access to more Realms and therefore different powers
- **Corrupt** Backgrounds it touches

To design the Demon do this:

1. Decide on the **Form**, e.g.
   - A pact with higher powers
   - Channeling the energies of other planes, i.e. sorcery
   - A monstrous dark half (e.g. lycanthropy)
   - Exceptional skill or dedication (e.g. the greatest warrior, stepping between shadows)
2. Tag one of your Ability Scores as the Demon's **Root** (this is used in Worldbuilding)
   - Mark off any one of the notches on the Demon Track on that segment
   - Start with a single Magic Die
3. Work out your PC's **Elan**, their current tally of how much they're in debt to the Demon
   - Up to the game group what kind of score to work with. 300 is low level, 900 is middling and 1500 would be high
   - For every 100 points of Elan, mark off another notch on the Demon Track
   - When all three notches under a House have been marked, mark that house and gain another Magic Die (most likely players would mark contiguous notches on the track)
4. If even one notch is in a segment tagged with a Background, that Background is marked as Corrupted

### 1.4 Shared Worldbuilding

For the final bit of character generation, go around the table and have each player describe

- Homeland (from Family background)
  - ask the player to put their homeland on a map (as specific or vaguely as you like)
  - ask the player about their home experience, like what are the foods, natural dangers, dominant gods, etc.
- A Group (from Company background)
  - ask the player what group they fell in with and include specific names if you like
  - ask them what this group was known for (good or bad), where it operated, etc.
- Legend (from Legacy background)
  - is it linked to a place, a tribe, another plane?
  - did it involve any kind of trial or ceremony?
- Root (from the Demon)
  - Describe how the Demon appeared to you. Was it a moment of crisis, did you have some kind of revelation, did you swear any oath?
- Corruption (from the Demon)
  - This will be something about the previously mentioned Background that has been tainted by the character's own ambition and negative actions
  - For a Family Background, consider the character's relationship to their family and its reputation, and reasons they might have been exiled from or fled their Homeland
  - For a Group, think about what might have happened to cause the character to part ways with comrades and what bad blood there might be between them
  - For a Legacy, consider any offences that the ancestor/tribe caused, or obligations they passed on to you

## 2.0 Playing

### 2.1 Ability Checks

In general, make **Ability Checks** by rolling as d20 trying get equal to or below that score but as high as you can. As a rule of thumb

- a result of 5+ is generally successful
- a result of 10+ is a great result
- a result of 1-4 is a partial success
- hitting your Ability Score exactly is a critical success

This is the basic procedure for all tests, combat rolls, saving throws, etc.

### 2.2 Advantage and Disadvantage

If you have a Background, cunning plan, superiour position, better equipment, or other benefit that might help with the attempt, you might get Advantage on the roll; roll 2d20 and pick the result you prefer. If you have some kind of penalty, you might get a Disadvantage; roll 2d20 and the Referee picks the result they prefer.

Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out.

### 2.3 Harm

The **Harm Track** has boxes equal to CON. When damage is taken, mark a box as follows:

- with a tick if the damage is just fatigue. Recovery over hours
- with a cross if it's a wound. Recover over days, with medical treatment
- with a star if it's a deep wound (or something else that's hard to heal). Recovery only with special treatment

If the Harm Track gets filled up, roll saving throw to prevent unconsciousness (if more than half the boxes are fatigue) or death (if more than half the boxes are wounds). Any further damage will turn ticks into crosses and crosses into stars on the track.

### 2.4 Angst

The **Angst Track** is filled up like the Harm Track, starting at 1. Angst increases:

- one point for every active Suit (spell)
- at points of cosmic significance (per the scenario)
- bad luck or karmic adjustment, per the Referee's judgement

When you roll a saving throw, if you pass but don't roll higher than your Angst, the Referee takes a token for later use. These tokens may be used to introduce random threats in the game.

Angst is not healed but can go down between adventures/campaigns, usually by defeating enemies, restoring peace and stability, etc.

### 2.5 Hazards and Saving Throws

Most of the time Saving Throws are against CON (physical stuff) or WIS (mental attacks) but sometimes another Ability Score may make more sense.

| Hazard                        | Saving Throw | Failed Save              |
|:----------------------------- |:------------ |:------------------------ |
| Poison, radiation, disease    | CON          | Take damage              |
| Paralysis                     | CON or STR   | Paralysed                |
| Petrification, Polymorph      | CON or CHA   | Physical change          |
| Devices (rods, staves, wands) | DEX          | Suffer effects of device |
| Dragon breath, explosions     | CON or DEX   | Take damage per effect   |
| Mind control spells           | INT          | In thrall                |
| Traps                         | INT or DEX   | Suffer effect of trap    |
| Illusions, trickery           | INT          | Confused or misdirected  |

## 3.0 Combat

### 3.1 Combat Terms

Combat is broken into **Rounds**. The order of action is **Initiative**.

**Attacks** and **Defences** are Ability Checks made by PCs.

Monsters don't roll dice; if they're close enough to attack, they attack and the PC defends.

PCs do damage to a monster's **Hit Points**.

Monsters do damage which causes **Harm** (*fatigue*, *wounds*, etc) to a PC.

### 3.2 Combat Stances

In a fight there are six kinds of **Combat Stance**:

| Ability | Stance       | Actions                                                                       |
|:------- |:------------ |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STR     | Pursue       | Attack as priority. Close distance with monsters. May be separated from party |
| CON     | Defend       | Defend as priority. If a monster comes into distance, attack                  |
| DEX     | Flank        | Hide as priority. If opportunity to attack, take the shot (missile, backstab) |
| INT     | Device/Magic | Cast a spell or use a magic item, do not attack                               |
| WIS     | Observe      | Wait and see. Do not attack, but able to alert rest of party                  |
| CHA     | Talk         | Don't attack, but take social action with enemy (intimidate, charm, etc.)     |

### 3.3 Combat Rounds

Every **Combat Round**:

1. Choose Combat Stance
2. Roll **Initiative** on DEX. If you pass you go before the monsters; if you fail, you go after
3. Resolve actions *before monsters*, including any attacks, readying spells, etc.
   - roll attacks by rolling vs STR and working out **Party Damage**
4. Monsters act
   - if monster is in range of party, assume they attack (unless they have some specific action)
   - Defend by rolling vs DEX (or CON, if you have cover/a shield etc.). If you fail, take **Monster Damage**
5. Resolve actions *after monsters*
   - roll attacks, etc.

### 3.4 Doing Damage

The damage system is asymmetrical. PCs take Harm, one box at a time. Monsters on the other hand have Hit Points and PCs might do 5, 10 or even 20+ points of damage in a hit.

For PC damage to Monsters:

- take the number rolled on the d20 for the attack as the base damage
- subtract the monster's AC
- add the damage done by the weapon (e.g. if it's 1d8 sword, roll that and add)

For Monsters doing damage to PCs:

- roll the dice specified in the monster stat block
- for each die, compare with the character's AC
  - if the die roll beats the AC by 1 or 2 points, mark Fatigue (tick)
  - if the die roll beats AC by 3 or more points, mark a Wound (cross)
  - if it doesn't beat AC, no damage is done
- **important**: monsters only do a *maximum* of one Harm per die rolled
  - if a monster stat block shows 2 (or more!) dice, resolve those two dice separately vs. the character's AC

*A note about Armour Class*: whilst the damage system is asymmetric, AC is on the same scale. Even 1 point of AC is worth having and in general AC1 is light armour, AC2 is medium and AC3 is heavy. Monsters regularly have more AC because they're huge, strange, not of this plane, have unexpected organs, or otherwise not as squishy as humans.

### 3.5 Monster stat blocks

Use “old school” monster stat blocks with as little modification as possible, using the unholy trinity of Armour Class, Hit Points and Damage.

* AC is ascending from 1 upwards (so convert by taking the difference from unarmoured AC9 or AC10, etc.)
* Hit dice should just be rolled as you would normally to get a pool of hit points per monster
* Damage is rolled as stated in the stat block. Either ignore any adds (e.g. the "+2" of "2d8+2") or convert those adds to an extra die (say, a cheeky 1d4)

Monsters might have all kinds of special/magical effects like poison, paralysis, spell effects, etc. Generally treat these as things that happen instead of a damage roll, using judgement (if the effect requires touch, if it's ranged, etc.).
