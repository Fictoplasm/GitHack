## 1.0 Creating Characters

### 1.1 Ability Scores

Generate the six **Ability Scores** using any method you like (point-buy, 3d6 down the line, 4d6 drop one, etc.). Range of each score is 3-18 with 10 being average.

This is what each Ability Score is used for:

| Ability      | Activity                                                              |
|:------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | opposing things physically (fighting, pushing, restraining etc)       |
| Constitution | surviving/resisting (fatigue, damage, poison, etc)                    |
| Dexterity    | default for many physical activities (manual dex, speed and agility)  |
| Intelligence | default for many mental tests (knowledge and reasoning, search/scan)  |
| Wisdom       | mental resistance and intuition (gut feel, empathy, willpower)        |
| Charisma     | interacting with people (communicating to impress, intimidate, charm) |

### 1.2 Backgrounds

PCs have three **Backgrounds**:

| Background | Summary                                  | Worldbuilding |
|:---------- |:---------------------------------------- |:------------- |
| Family     | Who you grew up with, what you learned   | Homeland      |
| Company    | Who you fell in with after you left home | Group         |
| Legacy     | Something you inherited at birth         | Legend        |

For each Background tag an Ability Score and write any details in the segment on the Wheel. All Backgrounds give you some kind of advantage in play (skills, experience, contacts, resources). There are no hard and fast rules on what makes each kind of Background, but here are some examples sorted by Ability Score:

#### Strength

| Strength | example                                 |
|:-------- |:--------------------------------------- |
| Family   | grew up in violent/dangerous situation  |
| Company  | joined a war band, mercenary unit, etc. |
| Legacy   | a weapon handed down by past generation |

#### Constitution

| Constitution | example                                        |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------- |
| Family       | grew up outdoors e.g. farming, animal training |
| Company      | joined explorers or travellers                 |
| Legacy       | immunity, resistance, unusual trait            |

#### Dexterity

| Dexterity | example                         |
|:--------- |:------------------------------- |
| Family    | family had a trade or craft     |
| Company   | apprenticed to a guild          |
| Legacy    | entrusted with an arcane device |

#### Intelligence

| Intelligence | example                                                                                 |
|:------------ |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family       | family were specialists of some kind e.g. guides, cartographers, scientists, historians |
| Company      | obtained a position in an organisation e.g. trading, politics                           |
| Legacy       | inherited membership of a secret society                                                |

#### Wisdom

| Wisdom  | example                                  |
|:------- |:---------------------------------------- |
| Family  | grew up in a cult or religious community |
| Company | joined a cult                            |
| Legacy  | innate magical sense or intuition        |

#### Charisma

| Charisma | example                                     |
|:-------- |:------------------------------------------- |
| Family   | grew up around influential or famous people |
| Company  | fell in with artists or players             |
| Legacy   | birthright (title, status, etc)             |

### 1.3 Demon

Your **Demon** is something that sets you apart from others. It could be literally a conjured being, but it could also be a connection to a god, arcane knowledge, or skill beyond what is normally thought possible. The really important points are:

- using the Demon's power causes it to grow
- when the Demon grows, it causes corruption in the character.

The six *Demonic Realms* of the Macrocosm map onto the Microcosm of the human Ability Scores:

| Microcosm    | Macrocosm   | Suits (spells)                  |
|:------------ |:----------- |:------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Puissance   | Force, destruction, combat      |
| Constitution | Durance     | Armour, wards, banishment       |
| Dexterity    | Contrivance | Transport, teleportation, gates |
| Intelligence | Voyance     | Scrying, divination, knowledge  |
| Wisdom       | Abeyance    | Conjuring and objects of desire |
| Charisma     | Obeisance   | Enchantments and possession     |

The Demon *infects* the Wheel via the **Demon Track**. As it grows the infection spreads, which will

- give the PC more **Magic Dice**,
- give access to more Realms and therefore different powers
- **Corrupt** Backgrounds it touches

To design the Demon do this:

1. Decide on the **Form**, e.g.
   - A pact with higher powers
   - Channeling the energies of other planes, i.e. sorcery
   - A monstrous dark half (e.g. lycanthropy)
   - Exceptional skill or dedication (e.g. the greatest warrior, stepping between shadows)
2. Tag one of your Ability Scores as the Demon's **Root** (this is used in Worldbuilding)
   - Mark off any one of the notches on the Demon Track on that segment
   - Start with a single Magic Die
3. Work out your PC's **Elan**, their current tally of how much they're in debt to the Demon
   - Up to the game group what kind of score to work with. 300 is low level, 900 is middling and 1500 would be high
   - For every 100 points of Elan, mark off another notch on the Demon Track
   - When all three notches under a House have been marked, mark that house and gain another Magic Die (most likely players would mark contiguous notches on the track)
4. If even one notch is in a segment tagged with a Background, that Background is marked as Corrupted

### 1.4 Shared Worldbuilding

For the final bit of character generation, go around the table and have each player describe

- Homeland (from Family background)
  - ask the player to put their homeland on a map (as specific or vaguely as you like)
  - ask the player about their home experience, like what are the foods, natural dangers, dominant gods, etc.
- A Group (from Company background)
  - ask the player what group they fell in with and include specific names if you like
  - ask them what this group was known for (good or bad), where it operated, etc.
- Legend (from Legacy background)
  - is it linked to a place, a tribe, another plane?
  - did it involve any kind of trial or ceremony?
- Root (from the Demon)
  - Describe how the Demon appeared to you. Was it a moment of crisis, did you have some kind of revelation, did you swear any oath?
- Corruption (from the Demon)
  - This will be something about the previously mentioned Background that has been tainted by the character's own ambition and negative actions
  - For a Family Background, consider the character's relationship to their family and its reputation, and reasons they might have been exiled from or fled their Homeland
  - For a Group, think about what might have happened to cause the character to part ways with comrades and what bad blood there might be between them
  - For a Legacy, consider any offences that the ancestor/tribe caused, or obligations they passed on to you

## 2.0 Playing

### 2.1 Ability Checks

In general, make **Ability Checks** by rolling as d20 trying get equal to or below that score but as high as you can. As a rule of thumb

- a result of 5+ is generally successful
- a result of 10+ is a great result
- a result of 1-4 is a partial success
- hitting your Ability Score exactly is a critical success

This is the basic procedure for all tests, combat rolls, saving throws, etc.

### 2.2 Advantage and Disadvantage

If you have a Background, cunning plan, superiour position, better equipment, or other benefit that might help with the attempt, you might get Advantage on the roll; roll 2d20 and pick the result you prefer. If you have some kind of penalty, you might get a Disadvantage; roll 2d20 and the Referee picks the result they prefer.

Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other out.

### 2.3 Harm

The **Harm Track** has boxes equal to CON. When damage is taken, mark a box as follows:

- with a tick if the damage is just fatigue. Recovery over hours
- with a cross if it's a wound. Recover over days, with medical treatment
- with a star if it's a deep wound (or something else that's hard to heal). Recovery only with special treatment

If the Harm Track gets filled up, roll saving throw to prevent unconsciousness (if more than half the boxes are fatigue) or death (if more than half the boxes are wounds). Any further damage will turn ticks into crosses and crosses into stars on the track.

### 2.4 Angst

The **Angst Track** is filled up like the Harm Track, starting at 1. Angst increases:

- one point for every active Suit (spell)
- at points of cosmic significance (per the scenario)
- bad luck or karmic adjustment, per the Referee's judgement

When you roll a saving throw, if you pass but don't roll higher than your Angst, the Referee takes a token for later use. These tokens may be used to introduce random threats in the game.

Angst is not healed but can go down between adventures/campaigns, usually by defeating enemies, restoring peace and stability, etc.

### 2.5 Hazards and Saving Throws

Most of the time Saving Throws are against CON (physical stuff) or WIS (mental attacks) but sometimes another Ability Score may make more sense.

| Hazard                        | Saving Throw | Failed Save              |
|:----------------------------- |:------------ |:------------------------ |
| Poison, radiation, disease    | CON          | Take damage              |
| Paralysis                     | CON or STR   | Paralysed                |
| Petrification, Polymorph      | CON or CHA   | Physical change          |
| Devices (rods, staves, wands) | DEX          | Suffer effects of device |
| Dragon breath, explosions     | CON or DEX   | Take damage per effect   |
| Mind control spells           | INT          | In thrall                |
| Traps                         | INT or DEX   | Suffer effect of trap    |
| Illusions, trickery           | INT          | Confused or misdirected  |

## 3.0 Combat

### 3.1 Combat Terms

Combat is broken into **Rounds**. The order of action is **Initiative**.

**Attacks** and **Defences** are Ability Checks made by PCs.

Monsters don't roll dice; if they're close enough to attack, they attack and the PC defends.

PCs do damage to a monster's **Hit Points**.

Monsters do damage which causes **Harm** (*fatigue*, *wounds*, etc) to a PC.

### 3.2 Combat Stances

In a fight there are six kinds of **Combat Stance**:

| Ability | Stance       | Actions                                                                       |
|:------- |:------------ |:----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| STR     | Pursue       | Attack as priority. Close distance with monsters. May be separated from party |
| CON     | Defend       | Defend as priority. If a monster comes into distance, attack                  |
| DEX     | Flank        | Hide as priority. If opportunity to attack, take the shot (missile, backstab) |
| INT     | Device/Magic | Cast a spell or use a magic item, do not attack                               |
| WIS     | Observe      | Wait and see. Do not attack, but able to alert rest of party                  |
| CHA     | Talk         | Don't attack, but take social action with enemy (intimidate, charm, etc.)     |

### 3.3 Combat Rounds

Every **Combat Round**:

1. Choose Combat Stance
2. Roll **Initiative** on DEX. If you pass you go before the monsters; if you fail, you go after
3. Resolve actions *before monsters*, including any attacks, readying spells, etc.
   - roll attacks by rolling vs STR and working out **Party Damage**
4. Monsters act
   - if monster is in range of party, assume they attack (unless they have some specific action)
   - Defend by rolling vs DEX (or CON, if you have cover/a shield etc.). If you fail, take **Monster Damage**
5. Resolve actions *after monsters*
   - roll attacks, etc.

### 3.4 Doing Damage

The damage system is asymmetrical. PCs take Harm, one box at a time. Monsters on the other hand have Hit Points and PCs might do 5, 10 or even 20+ points of damage in a hit.

For PC damage to Monsters:

- take the number rolled on the d20 for the attack as the base damage
- subtract the monster's AC
- add the damage done by the weapon (e.g. if it's 1d8 sword, roll that and add)

For Monsters doing damage to PCs:

- roll the dice specified in the monster stat block
- for each die, compare with the character's AC
  - if the die roll beats the AC by 1 or 2 points, mark Fatigue (tick)
  - if the die roll beats AC by 3 or more points, mark a Wound (cross)
  - if it doesn't beat AC, no damage is done
- **important**: monsters only do a *maximum* of one Harm per die rolled
  - if a monster stat block shows 2 (or more!) dice, resolve those two dice separately vs. the character's AC

*A note about Armour Class*: whilst the damage system is asymmetric, AC is on the same scale. Even 1 point of AC is worth having and in general AC1 is light armour, AC2 is medium and AC3 is heavy. Monsters regularly have more AC because they're huge, strange, not of this plane, have unexpected organs, or otherwise not as squishy as humans.

### 3.5 Monster stat blocks

Use “old school” monster stat blocks with as little modification as possible, using the unholy trinity of Armour Class, Hit Points and Damage.

* AC is ascending from 1 upwards (so convert by taking the difference from unarmoured AC9 or AC10, etc.)
* Hit dice should just be rolled as you would normally to get a pool of hit points per monster
* Damage is rolled as stated in the stat block. Either ignore any adds (e.g. the "+2" of "2d8+2") or convert those adds to an extra die (say, a cheeky 1d4)

Monsters might have all kinds of special/magical effects like poison, paralysis, spell effects, etc. Generally treat these as things that happen instead of a damage roll, using judgement (if the effect requires touch, if it's ranged, etc.).

## 4.0 Magic

To do magic:

1. Referee and player agree on the spell effect and the target number for the effect.
	- what the character can do depends on the **Circle** they have access to
	- the more challenging the spell, the higher the overall target number
	- at this point, the ref might also specify what could happen if the PC fails
2. Player rolls a d20 (or two) for the base casting.
	- any kind of preparation (rituals, a **Grimoire**, etc.) counts as advantage. Rushed casting might be at a disadvantage.
3. Player commits any number of Magic Dice (min 1) to the spell, rolling them
	- any roll of 8+ on a die is added to the PC's Elan
	- these dice are committed to the **Suit**, and can't be used for other things for as long as the spell is active
	- dice committed raise the PC's Angst 1-for-1 temporarily while the spell is active

### 5.1 Demons and Realms

Demons are treated subjectively (see the Character chapter) but all "magic" objectively comes from the Six Planes, sometimes called the Demonic Realms, Mittelmarches, Shining Lands, Six Heavens, &c. In game terms each Realm maps onto an ability score, reproducing the microcosm that is the mortal self in macrocosmic terms.

The Demon appears on the character sheet by marking the 36 segments around the character Wheel. If they have at least one segment marked in a given Ability Score they can access the Suits in (make *petitions* of) the corresponding Realm.

| Microcosm    | Macrocosm   | Suits                           |
|:------------ |:----------- |:------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Puissance   | Force, destruction, combat      |
| Constitution | Durance     | Armour, wards, banishment       |
| Dexterity    | Contrivance | Transport, teleportation, gates |
| Intelligence | Voyance     | Scrying, divination, knowledge  |
| Wisdom       | Abeyance    | Conjuring and objects of desire |
| Charisma     | Obeisance   | Enchantments and possession     |

### 5.2 Power Levels

The more powerful the Demon's root in that Realm, the greater access it will have to power.

| Circle | Prerequisite | Scope                                        | Difficulty |
|:------ |:------------ |:-------------------------------------------- |:---------- |
| First  | One segment  | Individuals, non-lethal, temporary, remedies | 10+        |
| Second | One House    | Groups, deadly force, lasting, dispelling    | 15+        |
| Third  | Both Houses  | Significant and permanent changes            | 25+        |

The **Grimoire** section has plenty of examples of spells and difficulties.

### 5.3 The Suit

Start forming the Suit with a conversation between the player and referee. This will nail down the effect and the difficulty.

The basic roll is a d20 roll vs. an Ability Score (as you would any other Ability test, saving throw, etc.). You could negotiate Advantage if you have special preparations (a scroll to work from, a ritual space, etc.). When you roll, the base effect will be whatever you rolled for your successful roll. So if you have a CON of 12 and you roll an 8 and a 19, the base effect is 8.

If you don't make the roll, the Suit just fails.

Next, decide how many d10 Magic Dice you're committing to the effect. Roll these and add to the base effect. If the sum is at least the Difficulty, the spell has worked as expected. Sometimes the strength of the overall spell matters (e.g. when causing damage) in which case make a note of the final total.

Whilst the Suit is in effect, the magic dice for the Suit are committed and can't be used for anything else.

If the final roll doesn't clear the set difficulty, the spell still works *but* with **Complications**.

#### Book Keeping

So your Suit worked! Do this:

1. Set any magic dice you used aside. They can't be used for anything else until the Suit is released.
2. For every Magic Die used, mark Fatigue (a tick on the Harm track). This will come back normally (and can be recovered *before* the Suit ends).
3. If any of your magic dice come up as an 8 or higher, add the number on the die to your Elan.

#### Complications

If you make the Ability Score check but don’t manage to hit the Difficulty number with your Magic Dice, your Suit has a Complication. Do this:

1. Mark Angst by 1 point for the first circle, 2 for second, and 3 for the third
2. Roll 1d20 to work out who is in the line of fire (see below)
3. Roll 2d6 for the Effect

The line of fire tells you who or what is affected:

| 1d20  | Who is in the line of fire?       |
|:----- |:--------------------------------- |
| 1-5   | The sorcerer                      |
| 6-9   | The sorcerer's allies             |
| 10-12 | Immediate surroundings            |
| 13-14 | Bystanders                        |
| 15    | Someone connected to the sorcerer |
| 16    | Someone connected to an ally      |
| 17    | Distant people or place           |
| 18-19 | Roll twice                        |
| 20    | Roll three times                  |

The Effect may be some kind of Harm, Blight, or Possession:

| 2d6   | Effect                  |
|:----- |:----------------------- |
| 2-3   | 1d8 damage per margin   |
| 4-5   | 1d6 damage per margin   |
| 6-8   | 1d4 damage per margin   |
| 9-10  | Blight/infection        |
| 11-12 | Inhabitation/possession |

Where "per margin" is the difference between the difficulty and what you finally rolled, "blight/infection" will be some kind of Deep Wound, and "Inhabitation/Possession" is where the Realm has not fully closed after the suit and has lodged in the place or person.

### 5.4 Forms

Forms are the aesthetics of magic. Some examples:

#### Glyphs

Glyphs are one-use, and must be inscribed on something, imbued into something, or otherwise attached to the object on which they function. When inscribing a glyph the sorcerer must decide the conditions on which the glyph is triggered, for example when someone is close to it (could be anyone, could be a particular race, or a named individual). It could be stepped on, intentionally touched, certain words spoken over it, and so on. It could also be ingested as a potion.

When triggered the glyph might deliver a deadly attack, or a message, or shift the object that it's bound to elsewhere, or bring an object from there to here, perhaps transmuting the object. It might reveal something not previously visible.
The base difficulty for any Glyph is 11. Variations will increase this a bit — an increase between 1 and 5 is probably reasonable, to be discussed with the referee.

#### Common Demons

Common demons are permanent forms (until released, destroyed or banished), may be bound into objects or autonomous, and may be anthropomorphised or alien. The sorcerer commits their magic dice to the demon, which may then use said dice to perform various services.

Demons have ability scores, which work much like PC scores, e.g. STR for attacking, INT for perception, CHA for communication, and so on. In play they're treated like ancillary PCs. Common demons are often incomplete, meaning they're missing some of the attributes that would otherwise make them whole like a human.

The various Ability Scores have the following effects for Demons:

| Ability Score | Function                      | Zero score                                    |
|:------------- |:----------------------------- |:--------------------------------------------- |
| Strength      | Do damage, carry things       | Cannot harm anything                          |
| Constitution  | Demon’s physical integrity    | Cannot resist any damage                      |
| Dexterity     | Independent motion            | Cannot move independently                     |
| Intelligence  | Independent thought           | Cannot act on instructions away from master   |
| Wisdom        | Sense and intuition           | Cannot perceive beyond immediate surroundings |
| Charisma      | Communicate, influence others | Cannot communicate                            |

Note however that a low or zero score doesn’t mean the demon is stupid, inarticulate or lacking personality, it just means there are things the demon physically can’t do because those parts of the demon are not adequately manifested on this plane of reality, and therefore it doesn’t have the capability to act. A demon sword without CHA may still gurgle and moan, it just can’t influence anyone by doing so.

Furthermore, demon Ability Scores are in flux, and they make use of the Magic Dice bequeathed them by their sorcerer to actually do something. Any demon with a non-zero Ability Score may enhance its score temporarily by rolling and attaching Magic Dice. A demon with a DEX of 5 may suddenly wish to move with greater speed; the player rolls a single Magic Die and gets a 7, making its DEX temporarily 12. This lasts for as long as the demon is required to take that form, after which it reverts to its base and frees up the Magic Die. Thus demons may morph their plastic form as the situation demands.

Some demons expend magic dice for using their powers. These refresh the following day.

When conjuring Demons, the base target number is 15, after which it is adjusted in the same way as Glyphs. The final score (1d20 + magic d10s) may then be divided against the base Ability Scores as needed.

#### Court Demons

Court demons are like their lesser counterparts, with the following distinctions:

* They are always complete, fully formed and independent.
* They are unique and named. Court Demons should be created as NPCs.
* They have access to the more exotic effects of that realm. These are detailed in the Grimoire.

Otherwise, Court Demons are formed exactly as their more common counterparts. However, because they usually demand such a large investment of magic at any one time, they're often only engaged for a short amount of time and then released back to their home realm. When they emerge they frequently cause significant local disruption which can include odour, miasma, emotional response, and disruption of the physical surroundings.

The base difficulty for summoning a Court Demon is 30, and a minimum of 3 dice must be committed to their conjuring. However the special abilities are effectively “free” and don’t need to be accounted for in the difficulty number.

### 5.5 The Grimoire

``In progress``

Here’s a rundown of the various Realms and the associated Glyphs, Common and Court Demons.

These are written as a general case rather than specific spells. In play the referee and players will create the spells on the fly, and spells should be unique to each sorcerer. I recommend the play group keeps a Grimoire of their spells to write glyphs and conjure demons (can be done as a group or individually). Keep them on index cards or in a notebook, etc. The Court cards may be especially useful (and you might want to keep a record of your ongoing relationship with those Demons). Give the spells fancy names.

#### Realm of Puissance

This Realm deals with all forms of destructive and harmful magic including magics that strike, grip, push, poison, corrode, infect, or inflict pain.

*Prime requisite*: Strength

*Typical service*: cause damage of 1d10 per Magic Die used in the casting.

*Variations*:

* cause pain
* burning (poisoning, burning, pestilence or causing other damage over a long period)
* push (lift up, push back, trip over, or something else that causes the target to move)
* area effect
* ranged effect

*Glyphs*: **battle glyphs** that directly harm when the target is nearby. Often used as a trap, or on the end of a weapon.

*Common Demons*: **Demon Weapons**. These are normally bound into actual weapons, and do the weapon’s damage plus any additional damage per their nature.

*Court Demons*: **the War-masters**. These are demon war-makers and warriors, destructive elementals and so on. They are generally rolled out as engines of war (sometimes on both sides).

#### Realm of Durance

This realm is about physical integrity, protection, and preservation. Effects include limiting physical damage, elemental harm (e.g. fire and cold) or other kinds of harm.

*Prime requisite*: Constitution

*Typical service*: resist damage. The glyph or demon can use 1d10 per Magic Die to resist damage dice on a 1 for 1 basis, e.g. if a monster rolls 2d8 for damage then each 1d8 can be opposed by 1d10. If the damage exceeds the demon’s resistance the die is lost (permanently for a glyph, until next day for a demon).  

*Variations*:

* resist a particular type of damage (e.g. fire)
* immunity to a particular weapon (wardpact)
* resist psychic damage or attack

*Glyphs*: **wards** that prevent physical or even psychic entry (scrying) into a place, talismans that protect against injury (e.g. fire)

*Common Demons*: **Demon Armour**. It may be actual armour, or more subtle protections woven into a cloak, jewellery or other clothing. Demon Armour usually just has CON but may have other attributes.

*Court Demons*: **the Guardians**. These are similar to the War-masters but they are normally conjured to guard a particular place; the demon is usually persuaded to by the sorcerer to adopt the area as its territory. Like the War-masters these tend to be violent and destructive demons, and frequently have wardpacts and other immunities.

#### Realm of Contrivance

This realm is concerned with all manner of travel through any terrain, plane or dimension.

*Prime requisite*: Dexterity

*Typical service*: allow movement from one place to another. Magic dice are used to enhance basic attributes for purposes of movement.

*Variations*:

* teleport
* speed
* carrying capacity
* vertical movement
* temporal movement

*Glyphs*: **transit glyphs**. These are glyphs that open doors, bring stored objects forth, or move things in time and space. They may transport those who touch them, or be consumed (e.g. a potion) to allow jumping or levitation.

*Common Demons*: **Transporters**. Typically these demons have CON, DEX (for speed), and STR (for carrying capacity). They may move in three or more dimensions, teleport from one location to another, etc. In play these are supplemented by the Magic Dice granted to them to allow them to transport their charges.

*Court Demons*: **the Gates**. These are the planar gatekeepers, enabling transit between distant or otherwise inaccessible locations. They often require not only conjuration but some kind of pledge or sacrifice for each traveller they admit.

#### Realm of Abeyance

This realm is about conjuration and transformation of objects.

*Prime requisite*: Intelligence

*Typical service*: reshape reality

*Variations*:

* A person
* A place
* An object
* A sensation

*Glyphs*: **glamours**. These are used to disguise the true worth of things, to briefly form illusions of light and sound and smell, and other tricks. However whilst the senses are often deceived the body won't be; so an illusion of water won't quench thirst, even though it looks and feels like water. Similarly an illusion of fire may give the sensation of heat, perhaps even pain, but it won't burn.

*Common Demons*: **Demons of Desire**. Demons of Desire often appear in forms aesthetically pleasing to their master. The relationship between demon and master may be intimate or simply based on transaction.

Demons of Desire use the Magic Dice invested in them to procure objects and services for their master. When the sorcerer asks the demon to procure something, the demon will state how difficult it is, then roll its INT and expend at least 1 magic die, which will come back in the next day.

Optionally the demon can be forced to expend CON permanently to get additional 1-use magic dice, which might be needed if it’s expended its allocation of magic dice for the day.

*Court Demons*: **Phantasmal Forces**. These are wish-granters which can be conjured and persuaded to alter reality. For example they might be able to make a nation forget who the king is, change the gravity in an area, procure something of fantastic value or power, hide an entire town, infect the dreams of a whole city, and so on.

#### Realm of Voyance

Demons of Knowledge are concern themselves with understanding the past, present and future, including the perception of all things.

*Prime requisite*: Wisdom

*Typical service*: all kinds of detection, distant scrying, probing the past or future

*Variations*:

* In the immediate vicinity
* A kind of object, group, or species
* A specific person
* Distant
* In the past
* In the future

*Glyphs*: **illuminations**. These are all kinds of minor detection magics, for example to determine whether a particular kind of object or person is nearby.

*Common Demons*: **Demons of Knowledge**. Demons of Knowledge use their powers to answer questions. At least one Magic Die is needed per question, using the Demon’s INT to answer the question.

*Court Demons*: **the Fates**. The highest orders of Demonic Knowledge, their vision is virtually boundless. They can be conjured to answer any question, but with one of the following conditions:

* Everything the Fates tell the sorcerer is true.
* Some of what the Fates say is true, and some is false.
* The prophecy will directly harm the sorcerer or their allies.

#### Realm of Obeisance

This is the realm of human affairs and interactions.

*Prime requisite*: Charisma

*Typical service*: influence mortal behaviour

*Variations*:

* Emotions
* Rational thoughts
* More than 1 person (a group, a court, a city, etc.)
* Commands to commit crimes
* Commands to sacrifice oneself

*Glyphs*: **charms**. Charms are glyphs that change mood and reactions. Sometimes they are worn as talismans, or consumed as potions, or suffered as marks applied surreptitiously to an unwary victim.

*Common Demons*: **Passing Demons**. These are demonic advisers, messengers, and other proxies who will act on the behalf of the sorcerer to achieve social effects (introductions, social manipulations, etc.).

Passing Demons will use their CHA to directly affect others. In addition they can place their own charms on others, by expending Magic Dice. The complexity of the charm will affect the number of dice needed and the roll required.

*Court Demons*: **the Possessors**. These are the most adept at human manipulation, and are conjured not simply to charm others, but to occupy human bodies. They are often encouraged to do so in the short term to achieve the sorcerer’s ends, with the understanding that they will continue occupying the body after the end of the contract.
