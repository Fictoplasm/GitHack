## 2.0 Characters

This chapter covers the characters you'll be playing. I'm assuming your general familiarity with the various fantasy gaming tropes (classes and archetypes, the kinds of activity, etc.).

The character creation steps are:

1. Pick **Ability Scores** (however your group likes to do it)
2. Choose 3 **Backgrounds**, including tagging Ability Scores with as much detail as you like
3. Decide on your **Demon**, any allegiances and corruption
4. Build the **World** with the other players.

### 2.1 The Wheel

The centre of the character sheet is the Wheel, with the Ability Scores arranged clockwise in the order from Strength through to Charisma. Ability Scores are written in each segment, along with any Backgrounds (if that score is tagged with a background).

Around the rim of the wheel is the Demon Track. This is used to keep track of a character's Demon and its influence over the character. As the Demon grows in power, more of the track is filled in and more of each segment is corrupted.

### 2.2 Ability Scores

Characters six Ability Scores, which are used for all manner of skill checks, saving throws and other risk rolls in play. The table below lists the kind of activity and the Archetype that's likely to have an above-average rating:

| Ability      | Activity                         | Archetype                  |
|:------------ |:-------------------------------- |:-------------------------- |
| Strength     | Fighting, pushing, restraining   | Warrior, gladiator, knight |
| Constitution | Surviving, resisting, working    | Ranger, scout, druid       |
| Dexterity    | Skill, grace, stealth, precision | Acrobat, thief, artisan    |
| Intelligence | Logic, reasoning, perception     | Sage, scholar, magician    |
| Wisdom       | Empathy, spirituality, intuition | Mystic, priest, witch      |
| Charisma     | Impress, intimidate, charm       | Bard, mountebank, artist   |

The range of each score is 3-18 with 10 being average; and since this is a d20 roll-under system, an average person would have a 50% chance of succeeding. There is a little more to it than that, particularly with Advantage (note that when you have an Advantage on the roll, the probabilities work out as if the score is 5 points higher).

Pick the point-buy or random method you like to generate the six scores, e.g. roll 3d6 straight down, roll 4d6 and drop one, spread 72 points between the scores, etc.

### 2.3 Backgrounds

If Ability Scores are raw talent, Backgrounds are life experience. All PCs have three distinct backgrounds:

| Background | Summary                                  | Worldbuilding |
|:---------- |:---------------------------------------- |:------------- |
| Family     | Who you grew up with, what you learned   | Homeland      |
| Company    | Who you fell in with after you left home | Group         |
| Legacy     | Something you inherited at birth         | Legend        |

Backgrounds do a couple of things:

1. As packages of skills and experience, they might skew a die roll in your favour (**Advantage**).
2. As flavour, they connect your PC to the game **World** (see below).

When you write each Background, tag an Ability Score and write down the details of your Background next to it. Once everyone has done that, proceed to the worldbuilding bit as a group.

#### Family

Your **Family** are the people you grew up around. This background includes the trials of life, family trades, and other experiences. Tag one of your Ability Scores:

| Tag          | Family                                                           |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | A harsh upbringing was harsh. You learned how to handle yourself |
| Constitution | Your early life was spent outdoors in a rural setting            |
| Dexterity    | Your family practiced a trade or craft                           |
| Intelligence | Your family were experts in a particular field                   |
| Wisdom       | Your family held particular beliefs                              |
| Charisma     | You grew up around influential, famous or mysterious people      |

Some further questions to ask yourself about your Family:

* What does your family do? What did you learn from them?
* What kind of upbringing did you have? Who raised you? Was it a parent, grandparent, gang, commune or village?
* What's your relationship with your family now?

When you come to build the World, Family will connect you to a Homeland.

#### Company

**Company** are the people you fell in with after you left home. Tag a new ability score for Company:

| Tag          | Company                                                    |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | You joined a war-band or other military unit               |
| Constitution | You fell in with travellers or explorers and saw the world |
| Dexterity    | You were apprenticed to a guild                            |
| Intelligence | You obtained a position of status in an organisation       |
| Wisdom       | You joined a cult or political movement                    |
| Charisma     | You fell in with artists and players                       |

When thinking about your Company, consider:

* What common skill, career or situation bound you together?
* Where did you travel with these people?

At the world-building phase, Company will connect you to a Group of people.

#### Legacy

Your Legacy is something you inherited from your ancestors that affects your life. It could be

* Something genetic, i.e. inherited traits from your bloodline
* An item you own
* Membership of a select group (allies, contacts)

. It could be something your ancestor did, something they left to you, something genetic or magical you inherited from them. Like all Backgrounds this can give you some kind of advantage, in this case in the form of Trappings. Tag a third and final ability score:

| Tag          | Legacy                                         |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | A weapon                                       |
| Constitution | Immunity or resistance                         |
| Dexterity    | Enhanced movement, permission to enter a place |
| Intelligence | Membership of a secret society                 |
| Wisdom       | A sense or intuition                           |
| Charisma     | Status, birthright, title, reputation          |

When thinking about your Legacy consider:

* Did your people come from a certain place?
* Did they make any enemies? Are they in debt to anyone?

At the world-building phase, your Legacy will be connected to some kind of Mystery or Legend.

### 2.4 Demon

Your **Demon** is your magic. Whether this is an actual demon conjured by a sorcerer, a priest's allegiance to a greater power, or some kind of self-actualisation or innate magic (supernatural powers, lycanthropy, etc.) it will work the same mechanically.

There are six demonic Realms that represent the magical macrocosm, which mirror the microcosm.
