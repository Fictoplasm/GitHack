## 4.0 Combat

Combat is a component of nearly all sword and sorcery.
The basic procedure is as follows:

1. Combat is divided into Rounds where PCs take action.
2. By “take action” we mean swing a sword, move a short distance, shout an order or a warning, interact with the environment, etc.
3. Initiative can be used to work out who goes first in any round.
4. In a combat round, if the PC is in range of a monster, they can roll an attack. Similarly if they're in range of the monster's attack, they roll defence against each monster. Both of these are d20 rolls like any other check.
5. If they hit the monster, they do damage equal to the d20 roll plus their weapon damage, minus the target's AC.
6. If they miss any defence roll, they take damage from the monster as stated (usually the monsters damage die vs. their worn AC)
7. Repeat this until either one side quits (or is dead), or if the combat is interrupted. The end!

There are more advanced options in the form of Stances, which are covered shortly.

### 4.1 Initiative

For Initiative all the PCs roll vs Dexterity. PCs who make the check act before the monsters, those who miss it act after. Acting first means a PC might be able to hide before the enemy engages them, or strike a blow that slays a monster before it can strike back.

If it matters which PC goes first, use the number on the die to give order of action, just as with a who does best check. This probably won’t matter most of the time because the party will probably be acting as a unit, but once in a while it might matter who goes first.

### 4.2 Armour Class

Armour Class soaks damage, and ranges from 0 (naked) up to high numbers. In combat subtract AC from the damage to get hit point damage (monsters) or wounds (PCs).

For PCs, AC 1 is sturdy adventuring clothes, buff coats and the like, 2 is leather, 3 is boiled leather, brigandine or other light chain armour and 4+ is serious plate and chain (and starts to get heavy).

Monster AC runs on the same scale but can run higher due to being massive (e.g. being a dragon), or non-human physiology (e.g. a carapace).

### 4.3 Damage Dice

For monsters, your monster stat block will show a number of dice that are rolled when a hit connects. These dice are rolled and compared against the PC’s Armour Class.

For weapons carried by PCs, non-magical weapons will have die sizes of 1d4, 1d6 and 1d8 for small-medium-large. Demon weapons will use one or more d10s. PC damage is worked out as part of the attack roll using the number on the d20, plus weapon damage rolled, minus the monster’s AC.

### 4.4 Attacking

Attacking is usually done with Strength. Strength is more than physical power, it's the will to do harm and violence. On occasion Dexterity (or even Wisdom) is more appropriate for e.g. ranged fire or sneak attacks.

When you roll an attack, if it's a hit you just use the number on the dice and subtract the Monster's Armour Class for damage. On top, if you're carrying any weapon, roll the dice for that weapon (1d4, 1d6 and 1d8 for small-medium-large non-magical weapons; demon weapons will use one or more d10s).

Even the weakest PCs will be slaying small, lightly armoured Monsters with one blow. This is as it should be. The PCs are meant to be double-hard bastards, capable of taking on hordes of Monsters.

### 4.5 Defending

Defending is often done with Dexterity though sometimes Constitution is appropriate if the PC is trying to hold up something between them and their foe (a massive shield, a heavy table or door, etc.). Wisdom may be appropriate for defending against psychic attack.

Defence rolls are usually a pass-fail only. If there is more than one attack then too many defence rolls could bog the action down. On a successful defence, the character avoids taking damage. Otherwise they take damage as stated on the Monster’s stat block.

### 4.6 Taking damage

When a monster does damage, it rolls all its damage dice and each die that scores above the PC's AC causes a hit on the Harm track. Obviously monsters with only 1 die damage of any size can only knock down a point of Harm at a time.

How the point of damage is marked on the track depends on how much damage is done:

* If the hit goes over AC by 1 or 2 points, mark it as a tick for Fatigue.
* If it goes over AC by 3 or more, mark it with a cross for a Wound.
* Deep Wounds are marked with a star and are caused under special circumstances, monster special effects, etc.

### 4.7 Monsters


Most play groups will already have access to plenty of monster books already, so rather than reinventing a monster list the intent is to use what the group already has.

#### Monster stat blocks

Use “old school” monster stat blocks with as little modification as possible, using the unholy trinity of Armour Class, Hit Points and Damage.

* AC is ascending from 1 upwards, so if you’re converting just use the difference between the given AC and the unarmoured value in that system
* Hit dice should just be rolled as you would normally to get a pool of hit points per monster.
* Damage is rolled as usual, whenever the monster hits their target. Any single die over the PC’s armour causes a hit.

#### Special effects

Monsters might have all kinds of special effects that don’t fall into the above categories. Some suggestions:

* The effect happens only if the monster scores damage on the PC. This works for e.g. poison or disease. In this case a damage tick might become a cross and a cross becomes a star. The effects might be immediate or they might only happen after the fight.
* The effect happens instead of the damage roll; so the PC still gets to defend, but armour doesn’t factor into it. This might make more sense than the one above if the effect isn’t stopped by armour (e.g. a touch range spell).
* The effect happens instead of the normal attack. This could work for a breath weapon or spell that has to be resisted in a different way by a different kind of saving throw.

For spell effects that cause a lot of physical damage like fireballs or dragon breath, translate the damage into a number of dice. A larger number of dice means more potential wounds/fatigue, and a larger die size means more of the dice are likely to stick. Saving throws just reduce the number of dice (by half, a quarter) before they’re rolled.

#### Example monsters


**Goblin**

AC 3, HP 5, Damage 1d6 (ranged or close). Come in waves from all directions. |

**Ghoul**

AC 3, HP 15, Damage 3d4 (claws and bite) plus paralysis for any hits that get through (see hazards).

**Dragon**

AC 8, HP 40, Damage 2d6 (claws) plus 1d12 (bite). Breath weapon up to 3 times in combat deals 5d8 damage from a corrosive cloud over a wide area (save to reduce number of dice).

**Grey Jelly**

AC 1, HP 20, Damage 2d8 (acid). After a successful hit it sticks to the target and will continue to deal damage unless removed. Jellies that stick will destroy 1 point of AC per round, at the start of each round before initiative is rolled.

### 4.8 Advanced Combat

Stances are basically statements of intent and ongoing mindset rolled into one. They're a bunch of assumptions about what your PC will do in the combat, like a mini program of if/then statements. They draw a box around what you are doing and what you're not doing.

There are six Stances, in line with the six Ability Scores:

|           | Engage        | Wait          | Avoid        |
|:--------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| Attacking | Pursuit (Str) | Defend (Con)  | Flank (Dex)  |
| Other     | Talk (Cha)    | Observe (Wis) | Device (Int) |

The Stances are simple enough to be put on an index card and picked up during combat by players (assuming we ever get to play F2F again).

There are three Attacking Stances, and three Other Stances. Attacking Stances are about making physical attacks on things. Other Stances are about doing other things in combat that aren’t directly attacking.

Then there are three kinds of Stance, which are:

- *Engage* where the PC directly confronts the enemy
- *Wait* where the PC observes and waits for the enemy to do something
- *Avoid* where the PC tries to avoid interference whilst doing their actions

This is also the order in which monsters will pay attention to (target) the PC; if you’re charging towards (or standing up and shouting at) the monster you’re more likely to attract fire than if you’re hanging back. Choosing a particular Stance doesn’t make you any better or worse able to defend however, it just makes it more likely that the monsters go after you.

All the Stances assume that if attacked, a person will defend themselves (or to put it differently, none of the options mean you’re not defending yourself).

#### Stances

**Pursuit (STR)**

If you’re pursuing the enemy, assume

1. Attacking is prioritised over all other actions. No matter what happens, you get to make an attack roll.
2. You attack as soon as you’re in range. If for some reason you’re out of range, move to get into distance.
3. You’re not hiding or staying in a fixed location. You’ll probably split off from any party members who aren’t attacking with you.
4. You’ll definitely attract the attention of the enemy.

For aggressive fighters. You’re not protecting anyone, but you’re haring off after the first target you can see

**Defend (CON)**

If you’re defending a person or place, assume

1. You will always move to put yourself between the enemy and who/whatever you’re protecting. Enemy will have to attack you before they can attack your charge.
2. If someone comes close enough to threaten, you automatically get to strike at them. If they’re not close enough, you can’t hit them.
3. You’re out in the open so you attract attention, although less than if you charge towards the enemy.

For bodyguards and defensive fighters protecting other party members.

**Flank (DEX)**

If you’re flanking the enemy, assume

1. Your first priority is to get into a superior position where you can attack, but the enemy can’t see you. (You might start the combat from this position already. If you try to do this in combat it will probably be a harder roll than if you were outside combat).
2. If you’re in this position, you get to attack. This may or may not attract attention.
3. If the enemy spots you, your attack is spoiled. Either try to hide again next round, or change your Stance to another attack and give up hiding.

For snipers and backstabbers!

**Talk (CHA)**

If you’re talking to the enemy in combat, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. If the enemy can understand you, they’ll hear your message, unless they’re being attacked at that moment. The ref will work out their response, e.g.
	- if you’re intimidating, they may pause or even flee
	- if you’re charming, they may stop fighting and engage in talks
	- if you’re taunting, they may make you their next target This is obviously for attempting social interaction in combat.

You’re definitely sticking your neck out, so there’s a high probability of drawing fire.

**Observe (WIS)**

If you’re observing what’s going on, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. You’re not making yourself obvious, but you’re not actively hiding either. You’re less of a threat/target than attacking party members.
3. You’re watching out for what’s going on.

If you alert someone else (e.g. to an ambush) the ref might credit that player with an advantage (or a roll if they would otherwise not get one). If you act yourself, you automatically gain the initiative next round, picking the Stance you want.

This is a catch-all for “wait and see” in combat. It can be used by anyone, and even non-combat types can use it to get involved in combat.

**Device (INT)**

If you’re trying to use a device, cast a spell, pick up an object or do something else with the environment, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. You’re doing your best to avoid the enemy’s attention. How successful this is will depend on whether there’s someone else more attention-grabbing in the fight.
3. If you’re attacked, it may delay or spoil whatever you’re trying to do.

This is a catch-all category for doing something in combat, but includes casting spells.


#### In Play

After the ref has introduced the scene and established that there is going to be a combat, the order of combat should go like this:

1. Roll for initiative.
2. On your PC’s turn, pick a Stance, and do what actions are prompted by that Stance (e.g. attack, get into cover, use a device, etc.)
3. On the monster’s turn, the ref will manage whatever is natural for the monsters (usually close with the PCs and attack)
4. At the end of the round, PCs hang onto their Stance cards.

At the next round if the player already holds a Stance card they can hand it in for a different card on their Initiative, or they can keep hold of it.

#### Variations

In play the ref might limit the number of Stance cards on the table.
Sample limitations and reasons:

* only allowing 2 Pursuit cards because the environment is too close, so only a couple of people can push to the front
* denying Observe cards because it’s impossible to see further than a few feet in thick fog
* denying Talk cards because the environment is too loud, or magically silenced

### 4.9 After the Combat

Following a battle, consider these steps:

1. Wipe fatigue away with post-battle rest, as much as the referee thinks is reasonable.
2. Anything worse than fatigue will need treatment. Take a tally of the wounds suffered, so you (the ref) has a good idea how battered the party is. Wounds are healed by doctors or by magic (for example from a Demon of Desire) and normally will need downtime but if the party has a physician or resources (salve, sutures etc.) then it might be fair to remove a wound. Deep wounds won’t be healed without special intervention, though.
3. Think about the enemy — did they rout or were they all slain? Will they come back in greater numbers? Will they inform on the party?
4. Deep wounds are likely to need special ingredients, rituals, or sacrifices. Roleplay this. When Deep Wounds heal, they will leave a scar. They should be visible, nagging and unpleasant, and spur the party to action.
5. If the battle was particularly taxing, consider raising Angst by 1 or more points.
6. Check in with the party what their next priority is.
