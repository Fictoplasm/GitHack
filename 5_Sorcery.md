## 5.0 Sorcery

Sorcery is obviously the other essential subsystem of this Sword and Sorcery engine.

### 5.1 Demon Basics

1. At any point in the game a Demon will have at least 1 magic Die, and may have more. Use these for Invocations.
2. When you Invoke the Demon, take their dice and assign for the effect per the Realm.
3. Roll the Demon's dice. The effect will happen whatever, but every die that comes up 8, 9 or 10 adds that number to the Demon's current Chaos.
4. The Invocation lasts for the scene. Note that dice used in the scene (e.g. for Demon Weapon damage) are not counted towards Chaos, they're just part of the effect for the scene.
5. If the Demon's Chaos hits its Threshold, a Metamorphosis happens, with Fallout.
6. The maximum number of Dice the Demon can have is equal to the number of Decans it has infected. You can escalate this number any time, but you can't reduce it until a Metamorphosis happens, at which point it drops back to 1.

### 5.2 Invocation, Chaos, Metamorphosis, Fallout, Taint

The Demon is always there, but it's only when a Protagonist **Invokes** their Demon that they use its power. Invocation might be called a Suit or Petition or Appeal or a Spell. When Invocations are made, take the Demon's dice and assign them to the effect, and then roll all of them. This is the time when the Demon's Chaos may go up.

An Invocation can be triggered by any suitable in-game event, and the trigger will be right for that character. Let's say a character carries a legendary sword. They might trigger it by drawing it with intent, if their Demon is their superlative skill. Or they might whisper to the sword and cause its runes to flame green, if it's an intelligent weapon conjured from beyond.

**Chaos** is the measure of how out of control the Demon is. Each Demon has its own Chaos rating which goes up with Invocations. Once Chaos hits a Threshold, the Demon will undergo Metamorphosis. The Threshold is equal to

``100 + 10x[number of Decans]``

**Metamorphosis** works like this:

1. Mark another Decan. If this Decan is over a Background, that Background is Tainted.
2. Work out Fallout. This will depend entirely on the situation, the protagonist, how their power presents itself, etc.
3. Reset the Demon's Dice to 1, and its Chaos to 0 (noting a new Threshold).
4. Raise the Angst at the table by 1 (for everybody) to represent the growing sense of doom and dread.

**Fallout** is the awful stuff that happens to the people around the sorcerer when their Demon hits a Threshold. As mentioned above it relies a lot on context, but in general here's some things that could happen (for the Ref to use their judgement):

- the area could be Warped.
- allies could suffer Backlash.
- onlookers could be Horrified.
- a bystander could be Hooked.

See the Ref's section for more details.

**Taint** is what happens to Backgrounds when at least one of the Decans in that segment is infected with a Demon. The Background still functions as always but gains a dark side which should be brought out in play. Leverage the world-building opportunities of Backgrounds to work this out: if it's Family, then there's something unresolved in the character's past. If it's Company, it's about something the character did with those people, or maybe a debt owed, or something else that causes them to reconnect. If it's Legacy, bring the mystery into play. Work this out between the player and the Ref.

### 5.3 Realms

There are six Demon Realms:

| Realm      | Powers                                              | Score |
|:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------|:------|
| Puissance  | demon weapons, fighters, raw energy and destruction | Str   |
| Durance    | demon armour, guardians, wards                      | Con |
| Conveyance | demon gates, transporters, doors                    | Dex |
| Voyance    | demons of knowledge, scrying                        | Int |
| Temperance | demons of desire, illusion, procurement             | Wis |
| Obeisance  | demons of seduction, commanding, terrorizing        | Cha |

Here's how you can spend Demon Dice in Invocations. The Spend column is the number of dice for each degree of freedom; the columns after are the degrees of freedom (how much damage, how far, how many people, and so on).

#### Puissance

Call these Weapons, Slayers, Bloodletters, Demon Fighters etc.

| Spend | Damage | Range | Extra effect | Independence |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | - | close | - | - |
| 1 | 1d10 | ranged | venom, stun, etc. | Independent fighter |
| 2 | 2d10 | far | long term effect e.g. curse | Complex instructions |
| More | +1d10 | + | + | + |

*Damage* is extra d10 damage dice you add on top of your weapon die. *Range* is how much further the weapon can strike over its normal range. *Effect* is any kind of bonus damage (immediate damage caused by venom; long term effects caused by curses, deep wounds, etc.). *Independence* is whether the weapon can act independently of the master (line of sight, or given complex instructions for assassination missions). 

#### Durance

These are Demons of Protection, Demon Armour and Shields, Guardians and Wards.

| Spend | Armour | Range | Resistance | Permission (Wards) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | - | anchored | no special resistance | 0 |
| 1 | 1d10 | nearby area | Simple hazards (fire, acid, etc.) | 1 |
| 2 | 2d10 | moves as directed | Significant dangers (deadly venom, etc.) | 2 |
| More | +1d10 | + | + | + |

Note that by default this demon is anchored to a place (as a Ward) or person (the master usually). If *Range* goes up, the area of protection either goes up or can move to protect more people.

*Armour* is d10 armour Dice in play. Roll these on the table; the Monsters have to overcome these Dice in combat before they can hit you. *Resistance* is some special kind of resistance. This will normally put aside lesser examples of the threat, and give Advantage on saving throws against greater threats. *Permission* is something that only really applies to Wards. Roll these like other Dice; when the Ward is interfered with by the thing that's trying to come through, the master will know. Mundane things don't know how to traverse Wards but someone with Demonic power (like a Demon Weapon) might attack them. 

#### Conveyance

These are the Demons of Travel, Teleportation, Gates, etc.

| Spend | Range | Capacity | Speed |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | Very short | Personal | Slow |
| 1 | Medium | Group | Fast |
| 2 | Far | Company | Very Fast |
| More | + | + | (Instantaneous) |

*Range* is how far the thing can take you before it has to rest. *Capacity* is how much the thing can carry. *Speed* is how fast.

To actually move instantly from one place to another speed needs to be 3+, at which point you can probably travel through solid objects (but you're not protected from landing somewhere fatal on the other end of the hop).

#### Voyance

Demons of Knowledge, Fortune-Tellers, Scrying Demons and Advisors.

| Spend | Range | Time | Dimension | Quesions | Senses |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | Close | Now | Here | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | Nearby | Recent/Soon | Liminal | 2 | 2 |
| 2 | Distant | Past/Future | Sidereal | 3 | 3 |
| More | + | + | + | + | + |

Like the other Demons, *Range* is about how distant the Demon's vision projects in the now, but there's also *Time* and *Dimension* aspects to how far the Demon can see.

Other degrees of freedom include how many *Questions* may be asked, and how many *Senses* are available to the master. These will still be dependent on the Range of the Demon's vision.


#### Temperance

Demons of Desire, the wish-granters and illusionists.

| Spend | Size | Quality | Intricacy |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | Small | Ethereal | Simple |
| 1 | Medium | Convincing | Shaped or Faceted |
| 2 | Large | Almost Real | Complex |
| More | + | Real | Masterwork |

These Demons conjure objects and sensations. They can heal, but they are unable to harm. *Size* will be how much of a thing, *Quality* will be how stable or real it feels, *Intricacy* is how complex.

#### Obeisance

Conniving Demons, Enchanters and other names for Demons operating in the human social sphere.

| Score | Minds | Number | Effect | Duration |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 0 | Weak, Suggestible, Animal | One Person | Nudge, Impulse | Brief |
| 1 | Critical, Human | Gathering | Feeling, Instinct | Scene |
| 2 | Alien, Demon | Crowd | Thought, Reasoning | Longer |
| More | + | + | + | Indefinite |

*Minds* are about intelligence but also resistance to thoughts, and more complex minds are harder simply because they're less human so harder to know what motivates them. *Number* is just the number to be affected, *Effect* is the kind of change, and *Duration* is obviously how long it lasts (note: "Indefinite" means until something significant happens to change the person's mind).
