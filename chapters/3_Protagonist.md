## 3.0 Protagonist

This is the Character Creation chapter. Your characters ("player character", "persona", etc.) are the most important people in the game. You as the controlling player are going to be particularly invested in this character but everyone at the table should be a fan of your character, and you of theirs.

Protagonists have

- six Ability Scores in the range 3-18 (10 average)
- various Backgrounds tagged to some of these Ability Scores
- Demons, also tied to Ability Scores
- other sundry bits like trappings, preferences, appearance, etc.

Nearly all of the Protagonist's info will be written onto the Wheel which dominates the character sheet. You can write free-form on the Wheel; Backgrounds go inside the circle, and Demons go outside (with notches on the wheel where the Demon attaches to the person).

### 3.1 Ability Scores

There are six Ability Scores:

|          | Cardinal | Fixed        | Mutable      |
|:---------|:---------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Physical | Strength | Constitution | Dexterity    |
| Mental   | Charisma | Wisdom       | Intelligence |

These go in order around the Wheel as Str-Con-Dex-Int-Wis-Cha. The Cardinal scores tend to be about engaging with things, whereas the Mutable are about observing and adapting. Fixed tend to be about capacity and resilience (and often get used for Saving Throws). However it's your RPG so use them interchangeably as the situation fits. Some suggestions:

| Score        | Situations                                                                 |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Strength     | Fighting, breaking things, restraining/holding on                          |
| Constitution | Enduring, resisting (poison, disease, fatigue, sleep)                      |
| Dexterity    | Crafting, finesse, grace, physical activity using balance/agility, stealth |
| Intelligence | Noticing things, comprehending, making connections, seeing fine details    |
| Wisdom       | Feeling/sensing things, willpower and mental fortitude, empathy            |
| Charisma     | Communicating and influencing, presentation, wit, performance, dance       |

Note the chance of success: if the average score is 10, that's a 50% chance on a 1d20 roll. In general, the chance of success will range from 30-70% before you factor in Advantage. Advantage/disadvantage is a bit like having the score shifted up or down by 5 points, although the marginal/complete/critical success probability won't scale exactly like that.

### 3.2 Backgrounds

Protagonists have 3 backgrounds:

- Family (homeland, people you grew up with)
- Company (people or organisation you fell in with as a young adult)
- Legacy (traits, secrets, inheritance, title or other benefit from ancestry)

Write the Backgrounds in a given segment on the Wheel. When you do something in play that leverages a Background, claim Advantage. Write them free-form and broad (e.g. "mercenaries", "troubadours", "Priesthood of Mu"). I suggest just starting with very simple statements and then fleshing them out in play / when it applies in the game.

### 3.3 Eminence

When you've defined your Backgrounds, consider up to three lines to describe your Eminence. This is what the other protagonists will know about you. It could be a reputation (for a general skill, for a specific event you were involved in) or it could be a demeanour (something you present in person). Make these face the other players (keep them in a shared document online, write them on a card and put it in front of you on the table, etc.)

If the protagonist somehow becomes marked or tainted, this will form part of their Eminence. It may even eclipse other things about the character.

### 3.4 Demons

"Magic" means Demons, although Demons don't necessarily present as "magic", setting-wise.

Demons are ambition, obsession, perfectionism, the need to externalise impossible ideas and feelings. They can be literally summoned entities from beyond normal human space, but they could also be supernatural powers from some beast within, or even obscene expertise far above what is generally thought possible (something that might get you burned at the stake in the wrong company). Demons make protagonists good, impossibly good, better than anyone "normal" could hope to be. They also have a cost, which is extracted when their master relies on them once too often.

Demons attach themselves to the outside of the Wheel, which is divided into 36 segments or Decans, 6 per Ability. This is where the demon is embedded, and once it's there, it's stuck. If you use your Demon it will grow and eventually undergo Metamorphosis; this is indicated by marking additional Decans on the Wheel.

There are six kinds of Demon, mapping onto the Ability Scores like an external supernatural design that imitates the internal, human self. These are Puissance (Str), Durance (Con), Conveyance (Dex), Voyance (Int), Temperance (Wis) and Obeisance (Cha). The number of Decans infected and Demons available will depend on the campaign (1-3 notches is weak, 9 would be strong and 15 could be powerful) but note that the game is playable with relatively untainted protagonists shoulder to shoulder with absolute monsters.

### 3.5 The rest of the character sheet

A few other things you may decide on and write down:

- preferred weapon, armour, fighting style if any
- default Stance in combat, if using Stances
- people and places, shared world-building
- faith, ethnicity, etc.

Make a note of how many boxes you have for the Harm track (equal to Con), and you're done.
