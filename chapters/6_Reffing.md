## 6.0 Reffing

This is a miscellaneous section with notes on running the game.

### 6.1 Principles

You don't need me to tell you how to run a RPG *but* here are some things I try to keep in mind:

1. The Ref is a leader, not a manager i.e. they're presenting situations not telling the players how to deal with them
2. Players play Protagonists, Ref plays the World
3. I designed this system so the PCs can be punished and pressured. They can take it, so dish it out. That's what the damage system is all about, that's what Angst and Markers are for. Push Consequences on the PCs, demand Saving Throws.
4. Up to you whether you allow second tries after failures. Two schools of thought, equally valid are (a) no, there's no way back, keep moving forward and make the Consequences change the situation, _or_ (b) sure, but you'll make the situation worse (raise Angst, give up a Marker, etc.).
5. Demons are part of protagonists, and their own thing, too. They have personality and they can be played if you want. If your demons are actual intelligent and articulate beings (like fairies) then consider having the player to the left of a protagonist play their demon from time to time.
6. There is no rule about what a Demon is, other than the Demon rules for the powers it give the protagonist.
7. I like emergent settings and I don't like heaps of background, although sometimes it matters. The game is **here** and **now**, _not_ somewhere else in another time. Bring the history and backstory and geography into the game at the time when it matters, when it fits the narrative.

### 6.2 Consequences

When a PC fails a roll, most of the time they just don't get what they want. Examples would be failing to investigate something, failing to gain entry to a place, etc. Whether you should be rolling dice for that is up to you.

Sometimes you set stakes before the roll and say that if the PC takes action and fails, there will be consequences. Some examples:

- Draw unwanted attention (blown cover, new people complicate the situation)
- Piss someone off (debt, revenge)
- Get separated, delayed or sidetracked by a bad situation (arrest, mugging, etc.)
- Lose something valuable (broken, dropped, stolen)
- Cause unintentional damage or harm or fatigue (yourself or someone else)
- Reverse advantage (e.g. the quarry turns around, backed up by friends)
- Raise Angst (individual or global) and describe how this manifests (foreshadowing, etc.)

Adding "hard consequences" to a failure is common for indie games (specifically PbtA) but if you're in the habit of rolling dice a lot, adding a consequence (other than "you don't succeed") can be exhausting. Not every die roll carries the same weight for the player. The Ref should telegraph the stakes if there are consequences.

Another approach is to only impose consequences when the situation is not "controlled" (per FitD). If the situation is Risky or Desperate then applying Consequences is reasonable.

Finally, when you're talking about a Tradeoff (i.e. a hit with 1-4) maybe soften the Consequence; but again that's going to depend on the stakes of the action.

### 6.3 Combat: Monsters

"Monsters" are anything that's a threat, that will hurt the Party if it gets close. Monsters have a brief stat block which includes AC, Hit Dice, Damage Dice and any special details written in a freeform description. Some examples:

`Goblin: AC2, HD1d6, Damage: knife(1d6), Overwhelm`  

Goblins are rubbish on their own but they turn up in mobs of 10 or more. The Ref should just dump a load of hit dice on the table and let the PCs hack away. "Overwhelm" means that normally any one person will be dealing with just one or two, but someone who charges in might get mobbed on all sides and have to defend against 4 different goblins at the same time.

`Cockatrice: AC5, HD5d6, Damage: beak(1d10+Petrification)`  

The Cockatrice has a lot of hit dice and a nasty attack. As well as damage, anyone hit needs to save against being turned to stone.

`Ghoul: AC6, HD2d8, Damage: claws(1d6/1d6),bite(1d8*Disease), Unpredictable & Fast`  

Ghouls spread disease through their mouths, but only if they inflict a Wound (Fatigue doesn't count). They're also Unpredictable and Fast so they don't obey normal rules about priority and can cross the arena very quickly.

I'm not going to write a bestiary because you already have one, but here are some general observations:

* increasing AC will make removing all dice harder, especially for non-fighter types. If the AC is lower all the party members have a good chance of removing some dice.
* increasing HD size will make the fight more swingy
* increasing the number of HD (either for 1 monster or several monsters) will make the fight take longer
* bigger damage dice will cause wounds, but small dice will wear down the party with Fatigue
* adding extra effects can massively change the combat; if a PC is taken out of the action (e.g. by petrification) this could be a burden on the party in the rest of the session
* on the other hand, adding effects that only take place after the combat is done won't change the pace, but may add complications later (e.g. disease)
* it's fine if the party blow through all the monsters quickly. Add more waves. Tell the party that in 5 rounds another 10 guards are turning up which will affect the chances of fighting through to the next area. Also let them have some easy victories

### 6.4 Combat: the Environment

If you want to pay attention to weapon lengths and the environment you're fighting in, here are some suggestions:

1. If everyone's free to move (like on a battlefield) then the side with longer weapons has a better chance. If one side has much longer weapons than the other (say a bunch of people are attacking a pike block) you might apply Disadvantage to the ones with the shorter weapons, until they successfully get in and make a hit. At that point, things could change as the skirmish gets close in...
2. ...and if everything is really close up and in your face, the person with the shorter weapon may have an advantage. Pikes will probably be dropped in favour of hangers and knives at that point.
3. If the physical space is constrained then trying to use a weapon too big puts you at a disadvantage (or advantage to dodge against that weapon). "Constrained" could be the room itself, or it could be a crowd. "Too big" might be a halberd in a cloister, a sword in a wine cellar, or anything bigger than a knife in a sauna.

### 6.5 Demons: Fallout

Here are some suggestions for Fallout following Metamorphosis:

| Fallout  | Effect                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|:---------|:------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Warped   | Physical and Perceptual | The surroundings are warped into strange forms. Distances change, new pathways to other spaces are opened up, people get lost in the area easily or see frightening sights, people sicken, animals mutate, foods taste different, colours are wrong, the sunrise is in the wrong place. |
| Backlash | Physical                | Other party members make a Saving Throw or suffer injury.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Horror   | Social                  | The community where this happened is horrified. They tell tales of the person who came through, and hunters go after the protagonist (someone from the community, or another person).                                                                                                   |
| Hooked   | Social                  | A bystander is somehow affected by the Demon. Perhaps a fragment lodges into their soul as the Metamorphosis happens. They are now ethereally connected to the Protagonist.                                                                                                             |
| Marker   | Special                 | If none of the above appeal, consider taking a Marker for later use. This represents bad luck or a price not yet paid.                                                                                                                                                                  |

### 6.6 666

| Human        | Warrior | Sorceror   |
|:-------------|:--------|:-----------|
| Strength     | Charge  | Puissance  |
| Constitution | Guard   | Durance    |
| Dexterity    | Flank   | Conveyance |
| Intelligence | Spot    | Voyance    |
| Wisdom       | Cast    | Temperance |
| Charisma     | Talk    | Obeisance  |

### 6.7 World-Building

**Eminence** is the tool in character creation that announced a Protagonist to the rest of the table. Going one step beyond Eminence, consider using Backgrounds to build the world around you (whether it's an established setting or your own). Family implies tribes, homelands, culture. Company points to factions and rivalries. Legacy is about mysteries of the world, dynasties, beliefs and other curiosities.

If you like Session Zero approaches for generating characters, consider going around the table and have each player announce something about the world that is relevant to the character and that the rest of the party will know as well. As Ref, build these up and maybe bring them out in later sessions.

Throughout play ask players about their Backgrounds. Anchor plot ideas to their Backgrounds in preference to inventing your own, if you can.
