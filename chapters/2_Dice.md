## 2.0 Dice

This engine uses polyhedral dice which you probably have lying around in excess. Just the standard set, mind (even numbers from 4-12 plus 20).

Have 2d20 on hand per player, as well as a handful of d10s (I have a ton of these from the 90s). The Ref will do well to also have a load of d6s handy.

### 2.1 Ability Checks

When you do something, you'll try to roll a d20 and get equal to or under an Ability Score, but you'll also want to roll as high as possible:

| Roll        | What Happens                    |
|:------------|:--------------------------------|
| Hit, 1-4    | Marginal success, with tradeoff |
| Hit, 5+     | Complete success                |
| Hit, 10+    | Critical success                |
| Miss (over) | Fail, Ref imposes consequences  |

### 2.2 Advantage and Disadvantage

When you have a Background that's useful for the plan, justify why it's appropriate (maybe narrate some backstory, a flashback, an anecdote, etc.) and claim an additional d20 as an Advantage. Roll 2d20 and pick the result you like.

Advantages can also come from cunning plans, superior positions, help from others, etc.

Disadvantages might be imposed where the situation is difficult or desperate. In that case roll 2d20 but the Ref picks the result to go with.

### 2.3 Dice Clocks

Dice Clocks are a pacing tool that the Ref might use at the table. For a given challenge they might throw down a bunch of dice, and you need to knock the dice out one by one, by rolling the face value on the die or higher on a successful roll. When all the dice are cleared, your task is done. This technique might be used for time-sensitive tasks (e.g. picking a lock in combat) and it can also be used in battle to keep track of large numbers of enemies.

### 2.4 Saving Throws

Saving Throws work just like another Ability Check. The difference is rather than the protagonist choosing to do something, saves come from something being imposed on the protagonist (a sudden hazard, poison, magic, etc.).

### 2.5 Damage Dice

In combat, weapons have one or more dice associated with them. These are rolled and added to the damage done in the fight. Demon weapons will have the die associated with the weapon's form, plus additional damage dice.

### 2.6 Demon Dice

Demon Dice are d10s. They're used to commit the Demon to a kind of effect. There are 6 types of demon, each with a list of permutations for what their magics can do and how committing dice to them affects the magic. When you invoke a demon, you take all the dice that it has active and roll them for the scene. Any result that comes up 8, 9 or 10 has that value added to the Demon's Chaos.
