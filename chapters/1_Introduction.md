## 1.0 Introduction

This is my OSR game. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This is a sort of "inverted OSR". More often than not the OSR follows a template of zero-to-hero, poor survivability at low levels, etc. StormHack's protagonists aren't fragile and they can take risks and survive. They're people who have already been places and seen things, and other people will have heard of them.

It's also inverted because the protagonists don't get experience, their Demons do. How much experience is up to the player, because it's directly tied to how much they use their demons in the first place (and you may or may not want to). But playing a PC with little or no demonic side next to a horribly tainted sorcerer is a viable game choice (say, a Moonglum to an Elric).

Aside from that... it's a fantasy RPG engine with all of the normal expectations you'd place on playing a fantasy RPG.

### 1.1 The Sword and Sorcery Genre

This game is explicitly "sword and sorcery" (first coined by Fritz Leiber in response to Michael Moorcock I believe). This probably doesn't matter at all to you, but there's a lot of Fantasy RPG stuff that isn't Sword and Sorcery, particularly the stuff with a hard-on for extensive world-building and trilogies. S&S fiction forms a body of work that maps out a wider fandom (e.g. the Hyborean age) but you can read the stories independently of one another. They are immediate and self-contained and don't need any wider context.

And there are two very obvious pillars of Sword and Sorcery, which are combat and magic, and these are big parts of the game system. But there's also the energy and competence of S&S protagonists. They're aware of their own mortality, but at the same time they're canny, brave and able to take risks (see above).

### 1.2 Inspiration

**Whitehack**, a very different OSR style game by Christian Mehrstam. Adaptable, freeform, no baggage, easy to make it yours.

The very first **Stormbringer** game (St Andre, Perrin, Chaosium). Very swingy character generation. Should be thought of as "roleplaying in the worlds of Moorcock" in the way CoC is "roleplaying in the worlds of Lovecraft" rather than cleaving to any authentic canon or presentation. Amazing approach to demon magic, like nothing else in the 80s.

**Sorcerer** by Ron Edwards. Great S&S bibliography in the first supplement, **Sorcerer and Sword**. When I read it I mentally connected with Stormbringer 1e. Inspired notions of demons as poorly defined, personal externalised ambition.
