# About GitHack

This is a roleplaying game based on an earlier project called StormHack, which was in turn inspired by the later OSR games as well as the original Stormbringer RPG by Ken St. Andre, Lynn Willis, *et al*.

The update creates a more generic system than the original, but with optional modules for specific implimentation. The ethos is still to have an OSR game where the characters begin powerful, able to take risks and act like the vigorous antiheroes of Appendix N fiction.

The updated document This has been hosted on GitHub as a public repo to allow cloning and forking of the project for your own needs. Further to this there are the following folders:

* the **Core** folder contains the core game
* **Extras** are alternative rules
* the **Modules** are for specific implementations in settings
* **Resources** are additional non-text content (e.g. graphics files)
