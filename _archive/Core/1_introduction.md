## 1.0 Introduction

This is my OSR game. There are many like it, but this one is mine. It's a remix of familiar OSR system objects and names from the Worlds Favourite Fantasy Game (such as Ability Scores, monster stat blocks, etc.).

Things that are like a "typical OSR game":

* Six ability scores (STR/CON/DEX/INT/WIS/CHA)
* Ability checks involve roll-under with a d20
* Saving throws are a kind of ability check
* Monsters have hit dice, armour class, and damage (typical stat blocks can be used with little or no conversion)

Things which are a bit different compared to a typical OSR game:

* freeform Backgrounds for the character's life events
* characters have "demons" (an actual dark side, supernatural patron, etc.)
* demons are what provides the character's magical powers, and grow as those powers are used, corrupting the character in turn
* There are no levels, and the human side of the character doesn’t gain experience
* On the other hand, all characters start off with a high level of competence and toughness

This should be the opposite of the "zero to hero” ethos in that the characters start strong and capable of taking risks, and all characters should be playable alongside each other whether they're powerful sorcerers or the roguish hero who eschews magical aid. But otherwise it should play like any other fantasy RPG.
