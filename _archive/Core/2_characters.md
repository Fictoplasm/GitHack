## 2.0 Characters

This chapter covers the characters you'll be playing. I'm assuming your general familiarity with the various fantasy gaming tropes (classes and archetypes, the kinds of activity, etc.).

The character creation steps are:

1. Pick **Ability Scores** (however your group likes to do it)
2. Choose 3 **Backgrounds**, including tagging Ability Scores with as much detail as you like
3. Decide on your **Demon**, any allegiances and corruption
4. Build the **World** with the other players.

### 2.1 The Wheel

The centre of the character sheet is the Wheel, with the Ability Scores arranged clockwise in the order from Strength through to Charisma. Ability Scores are written in each segment, along with any Backgrounds (if that score is tagged with a background).

Around the rim of the wheel is the Demon Track of 36 segments. This is used to keep track of a character's Demon and its influence over the character. As the Demon grows in power, more of the track is filled in and more of each segment is corrupted.

Just outside the track are the twelve Houses. When the three segments under a House are filled in, that House is also activated for additional magical power.

### 2.2 Ability Scores

Characters six Ability Scores, which are used for all manner of skill checks, saving throws and other risk rolls in play. The table below lists the kind of activity and the Archetype that's likely to have an above-average rating:

| Ability      | Activity                         | Archetype                  |
|:------------ |:-------------------------------- |:-------------------------- |
| Strength     | Fighting, pushing, restraining   | Warrior, gladiator, knight |
| Constitution | Surviving, resisting, working    | Ranger, scout, druid       |
| Dexterity    | Skill, grace, stealth, precision | Acrobat, thief, artisan    |
| Intelligence | Logic, reasoning, perception     | Sage, scholar, magician    |
| Wisdom       | Empathy, spirituality, intuition | Mystic, priest, witch      |
| Charisma     | Impress, intimidate, charm       | Bard, mountebank, artist   |

The range of each score is 3-18 with 10 being average; and since this is a d20 roll-under system, an average person would have a 50% chance of succeeding. There is a little more to it than that, particularly with Advantage (note that when you have an Advantage on the roll, the probabilities work out as if the score is 5 points higher).

Pick the point-buy or random method you like to generate the six scores, e.g. roll 3d6 straight down, roll 4d6 and drop one, spread 72 points between the scores, etc.

### 2.3 Backgrounds

If Ability Scores are raw talent, Backgrounds are life experience. All PCs have three distinct backgrounds:

| Background | Summary                                  | Worldbuilding |
|:---------- |:---------------------------------------- |:------------- |
| Family     | Who you grew up with, what you learned   | Homeland      |
| Company    | Who you fell in with after you left home | Group         |
| Legacy     | Something you inherited at birth         | Legend        |

Backgrounds do a couple of things:

1. As packages of skills and experience, they might skew a die roll in your favour (**Advantage**).
2. As flavour, they connect your PC to the game **World** (see below).

When you write each Background, tag an Ability Score and write down the details of your Background next to it. Once everyone has done that, proceed to the worldbuilding bit as a group.

#### Family

Your **Family** are the people you grew up around. This background includes the trials of life, family trades, and other experiences. Tag one of your Ability Scores:

| Tag          | Family                                                           |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | A harsh upbringing was harsh. You learned how to handle yourself |
| Constitution | Your early life was spent outdoors in a rural setting            |
| Dexterity    | Your family practiced a trade or craft                           |
| Intelligence | Your family were experts in a particular field                   |
| Wisdom       | Your family held particular beliefs                              |
| Charisma     | You grew up around influential, famous or mysterious people      |

Some further questions to ask yourself about your Family:

* What does your family do? What did you learn from them?
* What kind of upbringing did you have? Who raised you? Was it a parent, grandparent, gang, commune or village?
* What's your relationship with your family now?

When you come to build the World, Family will connect you to a Homeland.

#### Company

**Company** are the people you fell in with after you left home. Tag a new ability score for Company:

| Tag          | Company                                                    |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | You joined a war-band or other military unit               |
| Constitution | You fell in with travellers or explorers and saw the world |
| Dexterity    | You were apprenticed to a guild                            |
| Intelligence | You obtained a position of status in an organisation       |
| Wisdom       | You joined a cult or political movement                    |
| Charisma     | You fell in with artists and players                       |

When thinking about your Company, consider:

* What common skill, career or situation bound you together?
* Where did you travel with these people?

At the world-building phase, Company will connect you to a Group of people.

#### Legacy

Your Legacy is something you inherited from your ancestors that affects your life. It could be

* Something genetic, i.e. inherited traits from your bloodline
* An item you own
* Membership of a select group (allies, contacts)

. It could be something your ancestor did, something they left to you, something genetic or magical you inherited from them. Like all Backgrounds this can give you some kind of advantage, in this case in the form of Trappings. Tag a third and final ability score:

| Tag          | Legacy                                         |
|:------------ |:---------------------------------------------- |
| Strength     | A weapon                                       |
| Constitution | Immunity or resistance                         |
| Dexterity    | Enhanced movement, permission to enter a place |
| Intelligence | Membership of a secret society                 |
| Wisdom       | A sense or intuition                           |
| Charisma     | Status, birthright, title, reputation          |

When thinking about your Legacy consider:

* Did your people come from a certain place?
* Did they make any enemies? Are they in debt to anyone?

At the world-building phase, your Legacy will be connected to some kind of Mystery or Legend.

### 2.4 Demon

Your **Demon** is your magic. Whether this is an actual demon conjured by a sorcerer, a priest's allegiance to a greater power, or some kind of self-actualisation or innate magic (supernatural powers, lycanthropy, etc.) it will work the same mechanically.

Design your Demon:

1. Tag one of your Ability Scores to infect. This is the Demon's **Entry Point**. The tagged score doesn't need to be one of those you've tagged before.
2. Decide on your Demon's **Form**.
3. Mark off any one of the notches on the Demon Track (6 per ability score, 36 total). Start with a single Magic Die.
4. Work out your PC's Elan. For every 100 points of Elan, mark off another notch on the Demon Track.
5. Mark off extra magic dice. If the three notches under a House are marked, you get another die.
6. If the Demon's corruption enters a segment tagged with a Background, that Background is corrupted.

#### Entry Point and Need

Your Demon got in somewhere on the Wheel. Use this this Entry Point to decide how your Demon came about. Demons are all about meeting some **Need**, and the Entry Point will map onto a particular Realm; this will indicate the kind of aid the Demon provided.

There are six demonic Realms which map onto the six Ability Scores on the Wheel. Your Demon can access that Realm's **Suits** (magical petitions) if it has one or more segments ticked off. The six Realms and their relationship to the Ability Scores are:

| Microcosm    | Macrocosm   | Suits                           |
|:------------ |:----------- |:------------------------------- |
| Strength     | Puissance   | Force, destruction, combat      |
| Constitution | Durance     | Armour, wards, banishment       |
| Dexterity    | Contrivance | Transport, teleportation, gates |
| Intelligence | Voyance     | Scrying, divination, knowledge  |
| Wisdom       | Abeyance    | Conjuring and objects of desire |
| Charisma     | Obeisance   | Enchantments and possession     |

Some example Needs:

* I needed to survive (CON)
* I needed to understand (INT)
* I needed to control someone (CHA)
* I needed something from my dreams (WIS)

Although this is just colour, it should really round out the character.

#### Form

Next, decide what the Demon looks like and represents. Some examples:

* A Pact with higher powers (a god, a cult, etc.). Your Demon is your God or Master.
* Channeling the energies of other planes (sorcery). Your Demon is the elemental force itself; it may manifest as many minor demons or spells, but actual Demon is the magical macrocosm itself and your arcane science.
* Externalising some internal power or magic. Your Demon is your own dark half. It may be a physical transformation at times, or it may be wholly internal.

#### Elan

Next, mark off one Notch on the wheel, to indicate your Entry Point. Add one Magic Die for free. Set your Elan to 100 to start.

Now, the group should decide how much magical power is in play, both individually and at a group level. Before you do this, not that this game is designed so that PCs will little (or suppressed) magical ability can play perfectly well alongside the magically astute (or corrupt).

Here's a few suggestions on how to work out the starting power levels:

* Just agree. All the players say what their preference is for starting out. Low level might be below 300 points of Elan; medium up to 900; high at 1500 or more.
* Randomly. Use a formula like `Elan=(sum(nd10)*100)+d100` where n is a number between 0 and 3.
* Blind. The Referee puts a bunch of glass tokens in a bowl or bag. Each player reaches into the bag and draws out as many as they want in a single handful. Each red token is worth 50 Elan, green tokens are 200, black tokens get handed to the referee to cause misery later.

#### Dice

Once you know how much Elan you have, every 100 points is an extra notch on the Wheel. Every time the three notches under a House get marked, the PC gets access to that House and increases their Magic Dice by 1.

#### Corruption

If any notch marks a segment with one of the PC's Backgrounds, that Background is Corrupted.

### 2.5 World

Player background is "player facing" by default. In other words, the other players know your character, and more importantly the other PCs have heard of your character.

The final stage of character generation is the World. You're going to do this collaboratively around the table, going round the group three times.

This phase can take as long as the group likes. It may be an ideal way to round off a "session zero".

#### First round: Homelands

**Homelands** are linked to each PC's Family background. Going round the table, ask each player to point to their homeland. Other players (inc. ref) can also ask questions about the region or nation, for example:

* what are the natural predators?
* what does this region produce?
* what is the local government like?
* what is the attitude to magic?

For an established setting, if the player doesn't know then they might need to defer to the ref. But at the same time, they should be as creative as the group wants to be.

Also, describe the region in the context that the PC sees it. For example if they were born to wealth they're probably aware that there are poor citizens but their POV will be biased by their own experience.

Last, if any of the players has a corrupted Family background, also ask some pointed questions, for example:

* what is your family notorious for?
* how has your behaviour affected your family's reputation?
* what reprehensible act or twist of fate forced you away from your Homeland?
* who from your Homeland is hunting you, and why?

The player with the corrupted Background should play ball here, but they should also get to veto any question that implies a background that's really at odds with their concept.

#### Second round: Groups

Now you have the hang of things, go around the table again.

**Groups** are people the PCs have come into contact with, linked to Company. Each player should name a group of people they were connected with as part of their career. This is likely to be the people they actually trained with (a mercenary group, a guild, etc.) but it could also be a wider organisation of which their Company is a part (e.g. the guild they trained with is one of many). It could even be a rival organisation. This section is really about social organisation and how different interest groups interact.

Some sample questions:

* name one or two key characters in the group
* what are the group's well-known achievements or abilities?
* where and when is the group active?
* who are their enemies?
* what is their motif, gang colours, habits, territory, playground?

As before, spend as long as the players want. If any of them have a corrupted Company background, ask a few negative questions:

* what happened to cause your acrimonious parting with the group?
* what did you do with your Company that earned all of you a bad rep?

#### Third round: Legends

The final round is about creating mysteries and legends connected with your Legacy. Go as wildly creative with this one as you like. This could be anything from a heroic or notorious figure in the character's ancestry, to lost races, ancient feuds, debts to supernatural entities, origins from other dimensions, magically hidden territories or more.

Use the PC's stated Legacy to kick out ideas. Some starting points for questions:

* is the Legacy linked to a place, a people, another plane?
* did it involve hardship, a trial, or deed?
* is anyone jealous of the Legacy?

For corruption, consider these negative questions:

* what debt did your ancestor owe that you've now inherited?
* what offence did your ancestor or people cause?
* what taint does your blood carry?

### 2.6 Wrapping up

Basically, you're done. You may have some book-keeping to do, and some final touches like making a note of your CON and WIS on the various tracks, noting down preferred weapons and armour, clothes, trappings and so on. But otherwise, you should be ready for play!
