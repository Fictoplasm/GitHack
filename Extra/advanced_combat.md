# Advanced combat rules: Stances

Stances are basically statements of intent and ongoing mindset rolled into one. They're a bunch of assumptions about what your PC will do in the combat, like a mini program of if/then statements. They draw a box around what you are doing and what you're not doing.

There are six Stances, in line with the six Ability Scores:

|           | Engage        | Wait          | Avoid        |
|:--------- |:------------- |:------------- |:------------ |
| Attacking | Pursuit (Str) | Defend (Con)  | Flank (Dex)  |
| Other     | Talk (Cha)    | Observe (Wis) | Device (Int) |

The Stances are simple enough to be put on an index card and picked up during combat by players (assuming we ever get to play F2F again).

There are three Attacking Stances, and three Other Stances. Attacking Stances are about making physical attacks on things. Other Stances are about doing other things in combat that aren’t directly attacking.

Then there are three kinds of Stance, which are:

- *Engage* where the PC directly confronts the enemy
- *Wait* where the PC observes and waits for the enemy to do something
- *Avoid* where the PC tries to avoid interference whilst doing their actions

This is also the order in which monsters will pay attention to (target) the PC; if you’re charging towards (or standing up and shouting at) the monster you’re more likely to attract fire than if you’re hanging back. Choosing a particular Stance doesn’t make you any better or worse able to defend however, it just makes it more likely that the monsters go after you.

All the Stances assume that if attacked, a person will defend themselves (or to put it differently, none of the options mean you’re not defending yourself).

## Stances

**Pursuit (STR)**

If you’re pursuing the enemy, assume

1. Attacking is prioritised over all other actions. No matter what happens, you get to make an attack roll.
2. You attack as soon as you’re in range. If for some reason you’re out of range, move to get into distance.
3. You’re not hiding or staying in a fixed location. You’ll probably split off from any party members who aren’t attacking with you.
4. You’ll definitely attract the attention of the enemy.

For aggressive fighters. You’re not protecting anyone, but you’re haring off after the first target you can see

**Defend (CON)**

If you’re defending a person or place, assume

1. You will always move to put yourself between the enemy and who/whatever you’re protecting. Enemy will have to attack you before they can attack your charge.
2. If someone comes close enough to threaten, you automatically get to strike at them. If they’re not close enough, you can’t hit them.
3. You’re out in the open so you attract attention, although less than if you charge towards the enemy.

For bodyguards and defensive fighters protecting other party members.

**Flank (DEX)**

If you’re flanking the enemy, assume

1. Your first priority is to get into a superior position where you can attack, but the enemy can’t see you. (You might start the combat from this position already. If you try to do this in combat it will probably be a harder roll than if you were outside combat).
2. If you’re in this position, you get to attack. This may or may not attract attention.
3. If the enemy spots you, your attack is spoiled. Either try to hide again next round, or change your Stance to another attack and give up hiding.

For snipers and backstabbers!

**Talk (CHA)**

If you’re talking to the enemy in combat, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. If the enemy can understand you, they’ll hear your message, unless they’re being attacked at that moment. The ref will work out their response, e.g.
	- if you’re intimidating, they may pause or even flee
	- if you’re charming, they may stop fighting and engage in talks
	- if you’re taunting, they may make you their next target This is obviously for attempting social interaction in combat.

You’re definitely sticking your neck out, so there’s a high probability of drawing fire.

**Observe (WIS)**

If you’re observing what’s going on, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. You’re not making yourself obvious, but you’re not actively hiding either. You’re less of a threat/target than attacking party members.
3. You’re watching out for what’s going on.

If you alert someone else (e.g. to an ambush) the ref might credit that player with an advantage (or a roll if they would otherwise not get one). If you act yourself, you automatically gain the initiative next round, picking the Stance you want.

This is a catch-all for “wait and see” in combat. It can be used by anyone, and even non-combat types can use it to get involved in combat.

**Device (INT)**

If you’re trying to use a device, cast a spell, pick up an object or do something else with the environment, assume

1. You’re not attacking.
2. You’re doing your best to avoid the enemy’s attention. How successful this is will depend on whether there’s someone else more attention-grabbing in the fight.
3. If you’re attacked, it may delay or spoil whatever you’re trying to do.

This is a catch-all category for doing something in combat, but includes casting spells.


## In Play

After the ref has introduced the scene and established that there is going to be a combat, the order of combat should go like this:

1. Roll for initiative.
2. On your PC’s turn, pick a Stance, and do what actions are prompted by that Stance (e.g. attack, get into cover, use a device, etc.)
3. On the monster’s turn, the ref will manage whatever is natural for the monsters (usually close with the PCs and attack)
4. At the end of the round, PCs hang onto their Stance cards.

At the next round if the player already holds a Stance card they can hand it in for a different card on their Initiative, or they can keep hold of it.

## Variations

In play the ref might limit the number of Stance cards on the table.
Sample limitations and reasons:

* only allowing 2 Pursuit cards because the environment is too close, so only a couple of people can push to the front
* denying Observe cards because it’s impossible to see further than a few feet in thick fog
* denying Talk cards because the environment is too loud, or magically silenced
