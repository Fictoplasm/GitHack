# On Refereeing

I assume the reader has plenty of experience and I don’t need to explain either what a roleplaying game is or the finer points of playing or refereeing; BUT FWIW here are my eight principles for running this game:

1. Give the PCs the time and space to be themselves.
2. Reward ingenuity, proactivity, and character exposition from the players.
3. Start in media res. Don’t wait for the party to find each other, or to find the place where there’s danger and adventure.
4. Test the characters with violence and hardship. They can take it. This game is designed to be survivable from the outset, unlike typical OSR games. Demand saving throws regularly.
5. Increase Angst when there’s a setback, and lay the omens and portents on thick.
6. Make the surroundings fantastic and colourful. In particular, inject colour into every scene, even if it’s just a splash. Where appropriate, embrace Chaos and pervert the landscape.
7. Law and Chaos lords and their vassals interfere all the time. Have them drift in and out of the narrative.
8. You must read Moorcock if you want to run Moorcock.

Bear these in mind when adapting old Stormbringer (or indeed any) scenarios, which may be wonderful but also have the habit of allowing, or even forcing, the PCs to wander around. Edit the adventure savagely before play.
