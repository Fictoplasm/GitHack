# StormHack

*StormHack* is intended to emulate a classic 1980s RPG based on the multiversal fantasy of a British fantasy author. Previous versions were complete stand-alone systems. This version is an add-on to [GitHack](https://github.com/Fictoplasm/GitHack), and these notes make reference to that system.

Spot notes for using the Young Kingdoms as your setting:

1. Replace the generic "Demon" with "Patron" for this setting.
	1. Patrons are Lords of Law and Chaos, Beast Lords, Elemental Rulers, etc.
	2. Elan is the favour a character has with a given Lord.
	3. In theory you could have more than one Patron. In such a case, run two Elan counters and mark parts of the Demon Track depending on which Patron is corrupting which part. Otherwise, it shouldn't change mechanically.
2. Demons are a part of this setting; they are specific conjurations (Suits) of the Lords of Chaos.
	1. Some systems have considered Demons to be unique entities summoned by the sorcerer.
	2. Other systems consider "breeds" of demons (like an angelic hierarchy)
	3. Demon weapons, armour and other artifacts are a key part of some versions of the game.
3. This is an established setting with a map.
	1. Refer to Moorcock's books (primary sources) as well as existing RPGs (I recommend Mongoose's *Elric of Melnibone* for the most comprehensive treatment, and *Stormbringer* for the map).
	2. Homeland will be a particular location or nation. The other Backgrounds might have an attached geographic location, but note that S&S heroes often travel far and wide. It's not unreasonable for a character of Dharijoran birth to find themselves seeking adventure in the jungles on the Southern Continent.
4. Backgrounds are a good opportunity to establish ties to the Churches of Law or Chaos, in particular those Backgrounds that tag Wisdom.
5. The Young Kingdoms plausibly has many strange and forgotten races, so perfectly reasonable to create your own.
